// Fixture CONSUMERS for the baselining rehearsal (#593 phase 2).
//
// Each is a minimal repo in one of the shapes the fleet actually has, expressed
// as a path -> content map. They exist so a canon PR can be asked the question
// canon CI otherwise cannot answer: *if this change reached a consumer tonight,
// would that consumer still work?*
//
// Canon CI proves the canon is healthy, and that is not evidence about members —
// the canon's own packs are always already migrated, so a change that breaks
// every consumer passes it cleanly. #555 did exactly that.
//
// WHAT A SHAPE IS FOR. Not variety for its own sake: each shape is a distinct
// way the engine can break, drawn from a failure that really happened.
//
//   local-rules   a local pack with scoped rules and a bundled skill — the #555
//                 shape. A manifest contract change lands here first.
//   prose-only    a local pack with no rules at all: the manifest still has to
//                 validate, and a pack contributing zero rules must not be
//                 mistaken for a pack that failed to load.
//   canon-packs   no local pack. Isolates canon-side breakage from local-pack
//                 breakage, so a red rehearsal says which.
//   dormant       a member that declares itself dormant. Its mount falls behind
//                 BY DESIGN, and the rehearsal must not read that as failure.
//   versioned-local
//                 a local pack that declares the manifest's `version` field. Local
//                 packs are repo-owned and versionless by contract, so the fleet
//                 shape this covers is the OTHER direction: a member that adopts a
//                 newly-added optional field must not be rejected by an engine that
//                 defines it. The vocabulary is closed, so every widening of it is
//                 only additive on paper until a consumer's own manifest carries the
//                 new key through validation. It carries `seedOps` and
//                 `adoptionHandover` for the same reason — and note that a LOCAL pack
//                 declaring either does nothing, because only the install flow reads
//                 them and local packs have no install; the fixture proves the
//                 manifest VALIDATES, which is the half a member can be broken by.
//                 Every future widening of the vocabulary belongs here too.
//   legacy-task   a local pack whose scheduled task still declares the DEPRECATED
//                 task-level `session_scope` — the shape a consumer that predates
//                 the 2026-08-09 retirement still has on disk. It holds the
//                 retirement HARMLESS to such a member: red if the field ever
//                 stops validating or any future check starts blocking on it —
//                 the ways an un-migrated member would stop converging. What it
//                 does NOT cover is the routing itself: the rehearsal runs the
//                 vendor + the sweeps, never the scheduler, so that a lingering
//                 field still routes to the fleet label is a unit test's job
//                 (engine-tests/scheduler/session-scope.test.mjs).
//   code-work-env   a local pack whose agentless task carries a WORKER — the half no
//                 other shape has, and the half `task-code-work-env` (blocking, core)
//                 judges. A member's task code is member-owned and nothing converges
//                 it, so a rule that reads it can turn a member red overnight through
//                 no act of its own; this shape holds that harmless by carrying a
//                 worker that reads the code-work contract's variables and nothing else,
//                 which is what every member's task code already does.
//   growth-member a member enrolled in the growth lifecycle, carrying the local
//                 packs its capture runs write. The growth stages ship blocking
//                 work rules scoped to those runs, so this is the shape that
//                 answers whether an enrolled member's ORDINARY converge stays
//                 green under them.
//   pre-rules-index
//                 a member in the shape EVERY member has the night #807 reaches it:
//                 a CLAUDE.md of its own, no rules index, no import, no merge
//                 attribute. Nothing carries those to a member except the converge
//                 itself, and `rules-index-current` is blocking — so if the converge
//                 did not write all three in the same pass, this member goes red
//                 overnight through no act of its own. That is the whole question a
//                 migration record would otherwise have to answer, which is why this
//                 shape is the honest alternative to one here. It keeps its own
//                 CLAUDE.md content so the converge is also shown NOT to clobber a
//                 repo's instructions on its way in.
//
// A fixture carries NO `claudinite.ref`. That is deliberate: apply-vendor-set's
// #328 anti-rewind guard compares the prior ref against the canon checkout's
// HEAD, and a fixture has no honest ancestor to name. Omitting it skips the
// guard — the same escape a first-adoption repo legitimately takes — and keeps
// the rehearsal about the converge rather than about git ancestry.

// The declaration every fixture shares, plus its own packs.
//
// `core` is prepended to every fixture's list because it is mandatory and every
// real member carries it — the 2026-08-14 forced pass put it in all 11
// non-dormant members and the canon home (#842). A fixture declaring only
// `basics` would model a shape the fleet no longer has, and would model it in
// the one direction that hides a regression: the `requires` closure vendors
// core's content either way, so the mount looks complete while `isActive` reads
// false, and every rule and task the pack owns silently does not run. The
// `core-undeclared` fixture below pins that shape deliberately, once, instead of
// it being every fixture's accidental default.
