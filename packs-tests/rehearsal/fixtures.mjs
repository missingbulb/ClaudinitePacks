// Fixture CONSUMERS for the baselining rehearsal (#593 phase 2).
//
// Each is a minimal repo in one of the shapes the fleet actually has, expressed
// as a path -> content map. They exist so a canon PR can be asked the question
// canon CI otherwise cannot answer: *if this change reached a consumer tonight,
// would that consumer still work?*
//
// Canon CI proves the canon is healthy, and that is not evidence about members —
// the canon's own packs are always already migrated, so a change that breaks
// every consumer passes it cleanly. #555 did exactly that.
//
// WHAT A SHAPE IS FOR. Not variety for its own sake: each shape is a distinct
// way the engine can break, drawn from a failure that really happened.
//
//   local-rules   a local pack with scoped rules and a bundled skill — the #555
//                 shape. A manifest contract change lands here first.
//   prose-only    a local pack with no rules at all: the manifest still has to
//                 validate, and a pack contributing zero rules must not be
//                 mistaken for a pack that failed to load.
//   canon-packs   no local pack. Isolates canon-side breakage from local-pack
//                 breakage, so a red rehearsal says which.
//   dormant       a member that declares itself dormant. Its mount falls behind
//                 BY DESIGN, and the rehearsal must not read that as failure.
//
// A fixture carries NO `claudinite.ref`. That is deliberate: apply-vendor-set's
// #328 anti-rewind guard compares the prior ref against the canon checkout's
// HEAD, and a fixture has no honest ancestor to name. Omitting it skips the
// guard — the same escape a first-adoption repo legitimately takes — and keeps
// the rehearsal about the converge rather than about git ancestry.

// The declaration every fixture shares, plus its own packs.
