// A `manual` task's gate IS a human creating its work item. Nothing else can put
// one in the queue: the tick skips `frequency: 'manual'` outright, so an item
// exists only because someone asked for this task to run.
//
// The executor evaluates the precondition at pick regardless (tasks-dispatch
// DESIGN §6.4/§8 — "even forced work is admitted by code"), and for a manual task
// there is no anchor to roll to, so a no-go takes `noGoPlan`'s close branch: the
// item is CLOSED `outcome:obsolete` without ever running.
//
// These preconditions were written under the slot mechanism, where a forced run
// BYPASSED the precondition entirely ("a forced run bypasses it by design") and
// the declared verdict was consulted by nothing. The queue reversed that
// deliberately, which silently turned every such lever into a task that cannot be
// run at all — `sheepdog/fleet-baseline`, the fleet's converge lever, among them.
