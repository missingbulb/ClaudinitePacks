# Version history

Records for `packs/google-identity/pack.mjs`'s `version` field, one row per bump — added going forward from
the version this file was introduced beside (60820.1); earlier bumps are not backfilled.

| Version | Date | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| 60904.1 | 2026-09-04 | `google-client-id-single-origin`'s `doc:` pointer names its skill at `packs/google-identity/skills/…`, the path the tree carries (#1675). |
| 60822.1 | 2026-08-22 | The manifest stops restating its own tree (#1246): `id`, `prose`, `badge`, `skills`, `worldRules` and `workRules` are resolved from the pack directory and an absent `detect`/`marker` means no fingerprint. Coded rules move into `worldRules/`/`workRules/` and tests into `test/`, which no vendor set ships. `minEngineVersion` rises to the engine release that reads all of it. |
