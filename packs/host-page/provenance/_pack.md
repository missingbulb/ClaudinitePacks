## 2026-09-05 · born · Promote three member packs onto the canon shelf (#1693)
- **Source:** CrosswordChat's `local/host-page-adaptation`, generalized onto the shelf by the #1691
  consolidation of the fleet's local packs, with its member-specific citations stripped (the `xwd__`
  token, `page-adapter/`, the REQ ids, the fixture paths).
- **Reason:** no canon pack covered operating a web app from inside a page you do not own:
  web-scraping acquires a site's data from outside it, chrome-extension covers how your code reaches
  the page and says nothing about what to do once it is there, and headless-browser drives a browser
  you own.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** the pack manifest, declared by hand: declaration is the only thing that activates
  it.
- **Rejected:** a detection fingerprint. The shapes that would suggest the pack - a content script,
  a `dispatchEvent`, a `MutationObserver` - are equally the shapes of code running on its own page,
  so a marker that cannot tell a guest from a host would suspect the pack in every DOM repo in the
  fleet.
- **Landed:** #1693 (Closes #1692) · pack version 60904.1.

## 2026-09-25 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` rises to 60925.1
- **Reason:** this pack's checks declare `on_fail`, which an older engine does not read; the pack
  update holds this version until the member's engine is at 60925.1.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces.

## 2026-09-27 · born · a pitch paragraph for the dashboard's plain-repo view
- **Reason:** the dashboard shows a repo that does not run Claudinite the packs that fit it, and the
  owner asked for one paragraph per pack naming its main skills and process gains, with rough counts
  so it outlives the pack's growth.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `pitch` field, beside `ruleRoutingGuidance`.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the manifest becomes pack.json
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data is read with no import and by any tool; the conversion wrote
  the module's evaluated export, and the pack loads identically.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** pack.json, which the loader prefers over pack.mjs; a canon pack now needs engine
  60928.1, the first to read it.

## 2026-10-03 · scope-changed · the coded checks run on cn
- **Reason:** the three checks are rewritten in Go against the SDK, the call-site readings that
  lib.mjs held beside them, so a cn member runs them; the version also moves the pack off the
  two-part Node floor.
- **Actor:** build lead, ClaudinitePacks#30 T2.
- **Mechanism:** `checks/*.go` against the SDK, `test/` through `cn check --pack host-page`;
  `minEngineVersion` `61001.1.0`, the floor the SDK names. host-page 61003.1.

## 2026-10-04 · scope-changed · the version takes the <major>.<day>.<n> form
- **Reason:** pack versions follow the Engine's `<major>.<day>.<n>` scheme; an index sorts every
  earlier version below one in that form, so this one outranks what the pack store already holds.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking that pack versions follow the same scheme.
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5.5
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `version`, which the release now requires in this form for a new
  version. host-page 1.61004.1.
