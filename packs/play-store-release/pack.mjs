// Opt-in release stub pack: releasing to the Google Play Store (Play Console, signing, integrity, staged rollout). Declared when a project first ships
// there — no fingerprint until the first exercised release wires one.
// Stub — no rules captured yet; add durable, project-agnostic practices to RULES.md
// as they are earned. Expected first source: missingbulb/ShoutsAndWhispers.
