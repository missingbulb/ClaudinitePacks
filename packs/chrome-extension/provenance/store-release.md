## 2026-07-22 · born · the task absorbs the release workflow's own 00:30 cron (#396)
- **Source:** the per-project scheduling design: one scheduler per repo, and the release workflow's independent cron was a second one.
- **Reason:** the task fires the daily release leg; the workflow keeps only its push and manual triggers, so the Claudinite scheduler stays the repo's only cron.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** an agentless task (`model: 'none'`), code-work only: the whole decision is code, and the worker is a quick REST dispatch, so no session is spent.
- **Rejected:** keeping the workflow's own schedule beside the scheduler.
- **Retire when:** the scheduler stops being the repo's single cron, or the daily leg moves back into the workflow.
- **Landed:** #396 · pack version 1.

## 2026-09-02 · policy-changed · preconditions become `manifest-ahead || substantive-change`; shipping leaves the trigger (#1583)
- **Reason:** whether a repo ships the Chrome Web Store pipeline is a fact adoption settled, not a question worth re-asking nightly.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the unreleased-bump comparison becomes a task-local term in `preconditions.mjs` beside the declaration, since it compares two facts no shared term knows about each other; a repo that only codes an extension names `chrome-extension/store-release` in its `taskScheduler.disabledTasks`.
- **Rejected:** re-deriving ship-path precision here - the daily workflow does the authoritative shipped-file diff against the latest release tag, so this is the cheap pre-filter and the workflow the exact gate.
- **Landed:** #1583 (Refs #1578) · pack version 60902.1.

## 2026-09-03 · moved · the declaration becomes `task.json`; its comments become the task README (#1636)
- **Mechanism:** a declaration is data the scheduler reads and a schema validates, so it carries no comments; what the comments explained moves to the task's README, which an agentless task keeps in place of a `task.md`.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Landed:** #1636 · pack version 60902.2.

## 2026-09-05 · policy-changed · `expected_outcome` `none` becomes `no_code_changes` (#1707)
- **Mechanism:** the four-value vocabulary carries the target policy beside the outcome; the same behaviour under the word that sits beside `amend_existing_or_create_new_pr` and `supersede_existing_pr`.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Landed:** #1707 (Refs #1695) · pack version 60905.1.

## 2026-09-06 · policy-changed · `due:daily` joins the preconditions (#1733)
- **Mechanism:** scheduling is the task's own precondition; the scheduler keeps no state.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Landed:** #1733 · pack version 60906.1.
