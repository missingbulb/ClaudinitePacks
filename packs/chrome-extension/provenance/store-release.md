## 2026-07-22 · born · the task absorbs the release workflow's own 00:30 cron (#396)
- **Source:** the per-project scheduling design: one scheduler per repo, and the release workflow's independent cron was a second one.
- **Reason:** the task fires the daily release leg; the workflow keeps only its push and manual triggers, so the Claudinite scheduler stays the repo's only cron.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** an agentless task (`model: 'none'`), code-work only: the whole decision is code, and the worker is a quick REST dispatch, so no session is spent.
- **Rejected:** keeping the workflow's own schedule beside the scheduler.
- **Retire when:** the scheduler stops being the repo's single cron, or the daily leg moves back into the workflow.
- **Landed:** #396 · pack version 1.

## 2026-09-02 · policy-changed · preconditions become `manifest-ahead || substantive-change`; shipping leaves the trigger (#1583)
- **Reason:** whether a repo ships the Chrome Web Store pipeline is a fact adoption settled, not a question worth re-asking nightly.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the unreleased-bump comparison becomes a task-local term in `preconditions.mjs` beside the declaration, since it compares two facts no shared term knows about each other; a repo that only codes an extension names `chrome-extension/store-release` in its `taskScheduler.disabledTasks`.
- **Rejected:** re-deriving ship-path precision here - the daily workflow does the authoritative shipped-file diff against the latest release tag, so this is the cheap pre-filter and the workflow the exact gate.
- **Landed:** #1583 (Refs #1578) · pack version 60902.1.

## 2026-09-03 · moved · the declaration becomes `task.json`; its comments become the task README (#1636)
- **Mechanism:** a declaration is data the scheduler reads and a schema validates, so it carries no comments; what the comments explained moves to the task's README, which an agentless task keeps in place of a `task.md`.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Landed:** #1636 · pack version 60902.2.

## 2026-09-05 · policy-changed · `expected_outcome` `none` becomes `no_code_changes` (#1707)
- **Mechanism:** the four-value vocabulary carries the target policy beside the outcome; the same behaviour under the word that sits beside `amend_existing_or_create_new_pr` and `supersede_existing_pr`.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Landed:** #1707 (Refs #1695) · pack version 60905.1.

## 2026-09-06 · policy-changed · `due:daily` joins the preconditions (#1733)
- **Mechanism:** scheduling is the task's own precondition; the scheduler keeps no state.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Landed:** #1733 · pack version 60906.1.

## 2026-09-20 · policy-changed · its cadence is stated as a UTC period (#2182)
- **Reason:** the per-repo `taskScheduler` anchor let each repo move the boundary its cadence was
  measured against, which put a seam inside every day and never delivered the member-before-canon
  ordering it was kept for (#1995). How often this task runs is unchanged; what "a period" means is
  now the same everywhere.
- **Mechanism:** its `preconditions`, the only gate the scheduler reads, restated from
  `due:<cadence>` to `schedule:at-most-<cadence>`. The old spelling stays accepted permanently, so
  nothing here is a compatibility deadline.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Landed:** #2182

## 2026-09-22 · reworded · print-then-exit swept out of this element (#2225)
- **Reason:** a print immediately before `process.exit()` is discarded when stdout has not drained,
  so the status survived and the output did not; the exit sets `process.exitCode` now and the flow
  returns. No policy moved.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).

## 2026-09-22 · converted · The work step is declared as `code_worker_mjs` and the runner wraps it
- **Reason:** every worker re-implemented the same wrapping - the environment parsed by hand, the
  exit code, the failure line, the elapsed time, the agent-request file - and each copy was free to
  get it slightly differently wrong. The runner already owns the subprocess, so it owns the entry
  point: the module exports `worker(params)` and holds the work and nothing else.
- **Mechanism:** `code_worker_mjs` names the module beside the declaration; the executor spawns
  `claudinite-tasks`' own `worker-entry.mjs` around it, hands the module the parsed `CLAUDINITE_*`
  bag (the task's declared secrets and the Action token among it) and renders the verdict it returns
  into the queue's triage, requeue and agent-request protocol. No behaviour of the task changes: the
  same work runs, exits the same way and prints the same markers.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), who asked why every task re-implements one runner's job.
- **Model:** Opus 5
