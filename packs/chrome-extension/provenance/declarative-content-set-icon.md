## 2026-07-03 · born · promoted as prose from a member's local docs (c90f0c51)
- **Source:** GoogleCalendarEventCreator's local docs: the action icon stayed unset when `SetIcon` was built with `path`, with no throw and no console error.
- **Reason:** `declarativeContent` rules are evaluated by the browser process, so the icon must already be raw pixels at registration time; `imageData` is what survives, decoded from the packaged icon in the worker.
- **Actor:** the growth-promote run (phase 2 of the growth lifecycle), merged by @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** prose; checks did not exist yet.
- **Retire when:** Chrome makes `path` work there, or fail loudly.
- **Landed:** commit c90f0c51, the pre-pack corpus.

## 2026-07-26 · converted · becomes the blocking coded check, and the prose is deleted (#462)
- **Reason:** the failure is silent, so nothing else catches it, and the call has a static signature.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), consolidating six pending pull requests into one.
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** a coded world-scope check, blocking because nothing else reports the failure. Parsed, not grepped: the `declarativeContent.` qualifier is required so `chrome.action.setIcon({path})` - the correct use of the differently-cased API - stays quiet, and only the argument's own depth-1 keys are read; comments stripped first. The deletion test found the prose fully carried by the finding's why and fix, so the prose went.
- **Rejected:** a grep for `path:` (drowns in false alarms); `SetIcon` alone (ambiguous with the action API).
- **Landed:** #462 (Refs #435; conversion from #447) · pack version 1; two violating fixtures red when the key lookup is neutered, four false-positive guards green.

## 2026-08-12 · reworded · the check's `doc` pointer moves from `RULES.md` to the pack README (#780)
- **Reason:** the README's hand-kept index had drifted into claiming a prose rule "SetIcon needs imageData - prose + check" that was never committed, and the pointer sent a reader following a finding to a file that never explained it; the README now states the rule is carried by the check alone.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Landed:** #780 (Closes #777) · pack version 1.

## 2026-09-01 · reaffirmed · the retire test is written down for the revalidation pass (#1565)
- **Retire when:** re-test `path` on a current Chrome; retire only if Chrome makes `path` work, or fail loudly.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Landed:** #1565 (Refs #1564) · pack version 60901.1.

## 2026-09-25 · reworded · `severity: blocking|advisory` is spelled `on_fail: block|advise`
- **Reason:** owner decision, 2026-09-25: the field names what happens when the check fails, and
  *severity* keeps its impact sense; what this element enforces is unchanged.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
