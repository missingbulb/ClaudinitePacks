## 2026-07-06 · born · Context-relief architecture: packs (prose + checks) and skills, with enforcement (#128)
- **Reason:** the corpus was reorganized into two homes selected by WHEN a rule is active, and this
  pack is the one that is active in every session: cross-project working discipline, the task
  lifecycle, and the baseline engineering practice, whatever technology is running.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** a pack named `universal`, carrying `RULES.md` prose injected at session start and
  the checks that back it, discovered by a directory scan so there is no list to maintain.
- **Landed:** #128, closing #127 and #131.

## 2026-07-11 · scope-changed · No pack is active by default - the basics pack (né universal) is declared explicitly (#232)
- **Reason:** "universal" named a default nothing should have: a project says which packs it runs.
  The pack is never fingerprinted either, because the declaration is authoritative and dropping it
  is a deliberate choice rather than drift to detect.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the id becomes `basics`, and activation is the project's
  `.claudinite-settings.json` declaration, seeded by bootstrap and backfilled into existing
  consumers by the nightly update.
- **Landed:** #232.

## 2026-07-11 · scope-changed · Package-driven skills: packs declare skills, mounts generated at session start (#234)
- **Reason:** a skill is content a pack contributes, like its prose and its checks, rather than a
  tree the engine owns.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest declares the pack's skills and the session-start mount is generated
  from that declaration.
- **Landed:** #234.

## 2026-07-12 · scope-changed · Pack dependencies at baselining; settings validation replaces pack-declaration (#244)
- **Reason:** this pack is declared everywhere, so its `requires` closure is what puts another
  pack's rules in front of every session.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** a `requires` list on the manifest, materialized into the member's declaration.
- **Landed:** #244.

## 2026-07-21 · scope-changed · Vendored-mount surface shrink: engine/ consolidation, skills into packs (#384)
- **Reason:** a skill that every project's work can call for belongs to the pack every project
  declares; one that stops being a baseline activity moves to the pack whose projects need it.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** `skills/` moves inside the pack directory, mounted wherever the pack is declared.
- **Landed:** #384.

## 2026-08-06 · scope-changed · Move engineering-practices from a skill into basics/RULES.md (#661)
- **Reason:** the engineering-practices bullets were baseline discipline every session needs, not an
  activity a session reaches for, so a skill was the wrong rung.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the skill's content becomes `RULES.md` prose and the skill directory goes.
- **Landed:** #661.

## 2026-08-21 · scope-changed · The version bump belongs to the change, not to the release flow (#1151)
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the `bump-version` skill leaves this pack with the release flow it served.
- **Landed:** #1151.

## 2026-09-04 · scope-changed · Absorb barriers into basics, and stop it interviewing on adoption (#1684)
- **Reason:** no project ever chose the `barriers` pack; it rode in on this pack's `requires`
  closure, and a separate identity for a mechanism everyone already has bought only a second catalog
  row and an adoption question nobody had asked for.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the `barrier` rule and the contribution seam move onto this manifest, with the
  `contributes: { barriers: [...] }` key keeping its name because it names the mechanism rather than
  the pack that used to house it.
- **Landed:** #1684.

## 2026-09-07 · scope-changed · Retire the tidy-repo pack; absorb improve-comments into basics (#1842)
- **Reason:** tidy-repo's issue and PR sweeps had been outgrown and the comment pass was the one
  dimension left, which is baseline housekeeping with no second declaration to earn.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the `improve-comments` task and skill, and the `improve-comments-scope` gate, move
  onto this pack.
- **Landed:** #1842.

## 2026-09-25 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` rises to 60925.1
- **Reason:** this pack's checks declare `on_fail`, which an older engine does not read; the pack
  update holds this version until the member's engine is at 60925.1.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces.

## 2026-09-27 · born · a pitch paragraph for the dashboard's plain-repo view
- **Reason:** the dashboard shows a repo that does not run Claudinite the packs that fit it, and the
  owner asked for one paragraph per pack naming its main skills and process gains, with rough counts
  so it outlives the pack's growth.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `pitch` field, beside `ruleRoutingGuidance`.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the contributedRules seam leaves the manifest for contributed-rules.mjs
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data cannot hold a function, and the seam is the one piece of code
  the basics manifest carried.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** contributed-rules.mjs beside the manifest, found by name as worldRules/ is.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the manifest's comments leave it, their decisions recorded here
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data carries no comments. What they decided: claudinite-lifecycle
  is required rather than assumed, because basics is declared everywhere and the closure is what
  puts Claudinite's own rules in front of every session; git-github is required because it carries
  the git side of the task lifecycle (#385).
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests, their comments deleted or moved
  to a README or provenance.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the manifest becomes pack.json
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data is read with no import and by any tool; the conversion wrote
  the module's evaluated export, and the pack loads identically.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** pack.json, which the loader prefers over pack.mjs; a canon pack now needs engine
  60928.1, the first to read it.

## 2026-09-28 · scope-changed · pack contributions are retired, and basics interprets none
- **Reason:** no pack contributed a barrier, so the seam built nothing; a pack's fixed barrier is a
  declared forbidReferences check, and a repo's own is config.barriers.rules.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking to drop pack contributions altogether.
- **Mechanism:** none; contributed-rules.mjs and barriers.mjs are deleted, the engine calls no seam,
  and legacy-shape-in-use names a local manifest still carrying either field until #2395.

## 2026-10-02 · ported · task declarations and the ci-performance worker leave the Node runner
- **Reason:** the `$schema` key pointed at `claudinite-tasks/task.schema.json`, which left with the Node runner; the engine validates a declaration itself (`cn tasks contract`) and publishes no schema file, so the key is dropped as the hello pack's tasks do. The ci-performance worker imported the runner's tracker library and GitHub client.
- **Actor:** build lead, completing ClaudinitePacks #20 so the runner's removal lands with every importer ported.
- **Mechanism:** the worker takes its tracker through `@claudinite/sdk` (`github.findOrCreateTracker`/`writeTracker`, granted in pack.json) and its Actions reads through a pack-local REST copy on the job's token; the tests answer through the SDK stand-in and `cn tasks`. basics 61002.2.

## 2026-10-04 · scope-changed · the version takes the <major>.<day>.<n> form
- **Reason:** pack versions follow the Engine's `<major>.<day>.<n>` scheme; an index sorts every
  earlier version below one in that form, so this one outranks what the pack store already holds.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking that pack versions follow the same scheme.
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5.5
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `version`, which the release now requires in this form for a new
  version. basics 1.61004.1.
