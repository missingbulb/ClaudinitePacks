# Searching for a tool

- **A search that finds nothing** is evidence about your query, not about the environment: the bare
  short name returns "no matching tools", which reads exactly like absence.
- **Search the fully-qualified name** — `select:mcp__<server>__<tool>`, copied off the
  deferred-tools listing — and try the tool before telling the owner a step is theirs.
- **A server whose whole roster the deferred-tools listing already names** is the one exception: one
  miss there is the answer, so read the roster rather than rephrase the query.
