// WHY. A page names the released version in a `title="version …"` attribute, so a
// visitor can say which build they are looking at. That number is a copy of
// `package.json`'s version — the single record a release advances — and a copy that
// drifts is worse than no number at all: it names a build that is not the one being
// served, and nothing about the page looks wrong.
//
// The copy is generated, not hand-maintained: the bump writes the version into
// `package.json` and stamps it into every page that carries the attribute, in the
// same run. This rule is that generator's drift guard — it fires on what a
// hand-edit, a half-applied release, or a page added without the stamp all look
// like.
//
// SCOPE. Every tracked page that carries a stamp, wherever it sits: the stamp is the
// page's own opt-in, and this pack knows nothing about which directory is served. A
// page without one has made no claim to check.
