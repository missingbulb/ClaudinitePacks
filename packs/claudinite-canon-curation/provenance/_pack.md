## 2026-07-13 · born · Dissolve growth/ into packs: canon-curation (home-only) + grow_with_claudinite (#284)
- **Reason:** growth became fully pack-based and the top-level `growth/` folder went with it, so the
  canon home's own curation duties needed a home of their own.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** a pack manifest with `detect: null`, never seeded by `--init` or any migration and
  declared by hand in exactly one repo. Declaration cardinality is what makes its tasks
  central-once: a pack's tasks run per declaring repo, so one declaring repo yields one unit per
  occurrence with no orchestrator step.
- **Landed:** #284 (Closes #281).

## 2026-07-20 · moved · canon-curation moves to local_packs (#361)
- **Reason:** Claudinite-maintaining-Claudinite is project-specific content, so it rides the home's
  own capture surface.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the pack moves from `packs/canon-curation/` to
  `.claudinite/local_packs/canon-curation/`, declared as `local_packs/canon-curation`.
- **Landed:** #361 (Closes #360, Closes #364).

## 2026-09-01 · moved · Promote canon curation into a canon pack (#1541)
- **Reason:** the duties generalize to any repo hosting a shelf of packs, so they belong on the
  shelf rather than in one repo's own tree. Hidden, not seeded by default and without a fingerprint:
  a canon home is a role somebody assigns, so the pack is declared by hand.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** the pack moves to `packs/claudinite-canon-curation/`. Nothing in it names a
  particular canon: the shelf is `packs/` because that is where the engine reads a canon's packs
  from, and the one thing a canon can differ on - a second corpus root beside `packs/` - is the
  optional `write_paths` config.
- **Rejected:** keeping the hardcoded `packs/` plus `skills/` write surface, which matched nothing
  here, and gating the skill check on the engine's own tracked registry, which only the engine's
  home satisfies.
- **Landed:** #1541 (Closes #1537) · pack version 60831.1.

## 2026-09-25 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` rises to 60925.1
- **Reason:** this pack's checks declare `on_fail`, which an older engine does not read; the pack
  update holds this version until the member's engine is at 60925.1.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the manifest's comments leave it, their decisions recorded here
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data carries no comments. What they decided: hidden because a canon
  home is a role somebody assigns, not a shape a fingerprint can suspect. Shelf segregation is
  barrier data (pack-independence, a declared forbidReferences check whose allow list is the engine
  surface), never code this pack runs. A pack's version is cut on the base branch by this pack's
  pack-version-bump task, never by the change itself.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests, their comments deleted or moved
  to a README or provenance.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the manifest becomes pack.json
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data is read with no import and by any tool; the conversion wrote
  the module's evaluated export, and the pack loads identically.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** pack.json, which the loader prefers over pack.mjs; a canon pack now needs engine
  60928.1, the first to read it.

## 2026-10-02 · ported · task declarations and the pack-version workers leave the Node runner
- **Reason:** the `$schema` key pointed at `claudinite-tasks/task.schema.json`, which left with the Node runner; the engine validates a declaration itself (`cn tasks contract`) and publishes no schema file, so the key is dropped as the hello pack's tasks do. The pack-version workers pushed and opened pull requests through the runner's delivery modules, and two declared checks judged its `src/` tree.
- **Actor:** build lead, completing ClaudinitePacks #20 so the runner's removal lands with every importer ported.
- **Mechanism:** the workers push through the SDK's `git` and open through `github.openPr` (granted in pack.json), pack-version-history carrying its own delivery copy; the two `src/`-scoped checks are retired. canon-curation 61002.1.
