## 2026-09-15 · born · Scope claudinite-growth to local packs, give the shelf its own tasks (#2047)
- **Reason:** the growth sweeps declared a local-pack write surface but a config key widened them
  onto the canon shelf, so every canon-side run produced a diff its own policy could not cover and
  parked. A pack owns a corpus rather than a config key naming one; widening the growth policy would
  have authorised every member's growth task to write a tree it must never touch.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** a task over the shelf, automerging `under:packs`, whose corpus is the canon
  config's roots so nothing here names a particular canon. It loads the growth pack's
  prose-to-checks skill, which states the method and names no corpus. The run titles itself
  `Claudinite canon: …` so the growth write-scope gate reads it as out of its scope.
- **Landed:** #2047 (Closes #2044) · pack version 60915.3.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · names the manifest as pack.json, or by role
- **Reason:** pack.json is the preferred manifest; where the text told a reader to list a module in
  pack.mjs, rules are found in worldRules/ and workRules/ and nothing is listed.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.

## 2026-10-03 · policy-changed · a converted rule lands as a declared or Go check
- **Reason:** the shelf runs on cn, which runs declared checks and Go checks on the check SDK and no
  `worldRules/` module.
- **Actor:** Claude, ClaudinitePacks#30 T3.
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5.5
- **Mechanism:** the task's instructions.
