// growth-promote — the growth lifecycle's CENTRAL stage. Reads the participating
// members' local packs, generalizes the portable lessons, and opens an owner-gated
// PR against the canon. A fleet-reaching task: it runs on the canon home repo's own
// scheduler, and its precondition reads the `fleet` signal — the members aggregate
// over the fleet PAT.
//
// Self-contained (imports nothing): the whole contract is this default export.
//
// "Central, once" is enforced by declaration cardinality, not orchestrator wiring:
// a canon is declared by its one home repo, so this task exists nowhere else. No
// barrier — promote reads whatever is already MERGED on members' default branches,
// so a lesson extracted tonight is promoted on the same run when its auto-merge
// landed in time, else the next one.

  // form and lives in the anchor: a canon home sets its daily hour after its members'.
  //
  // The WITHIN-repo half is declarable, and is: a canon home is a member too, so its own extract must
