## Why the declaration reads as it does

Carried over from the declaration's comments when it became `task.json`.

growth-discover-packs — the FLEET sweep for technologies the canon does not yet
home. One weekly pass over every member: read what the fleet is actually built
on, subtract what the canon's packs/ shelf already homes, and open a reviewed PR
authoring the missing pack.

The only pack-authoring stage there is. A member does not mint packs of its
own — its local packs are what adoption seeded, and growth-extract writes
rules into those — so a technology no canon pack homes is noticed and homed
here or nowhere.

Central because ONE run sees every member: first-sight dedup is trivial — the
third member using a technology is recognised as the same gap as the first,
with no cross-run state. That was the argument for keeping this central when
everything else moved per-repo.

No repo-side gate: the opportunity is standing — a technology the fleet uses
that no canon pack homes — rather than a recent change here, so the weekly
anchor is the whole trigger and the run no-ops cheaply when nothing is
unhomed. The fleet roster it sweeps is read by the run itself.
This task reads every member's tree, which an ordinary session in this repo does
not reach. Reach is a property of WHICH endpoint the hand-off calls, so a task
needing more than an ordinary session names one; the key resolves in this repo's
own config, and until it is configured the hand-off converges the item to triage
naming what is missing.
