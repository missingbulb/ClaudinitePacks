// growth-discover-packs — the FLEET sweep for technologies the canon does not yet
// home. One weekly pass over every member: read what the fleet is actually built
// on, subtract what the canon's packs/ shelf already homes, and open a reviewed PR
// authoring the missing pack.
//
// The only pack-authoring stage there is. A member does not mint packs of its
// own — its local packs are what adoption seeded, and growth-extract writes
// rules into those — so a technology no canon pack homes is noticed and homed
// here or nowhere.
//
// Central because ONE run sees every member: first-sight dedup is trivial — the
// third member using a technology is recognised as the same gap as the first,
// with no cross-run state. That was the argument for keeping this central when
// everything else moved per-repo.
//
// Self-contained (imports nothing): the whole contract is this default export.
