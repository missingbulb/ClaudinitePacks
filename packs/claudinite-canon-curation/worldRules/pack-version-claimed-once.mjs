// A PACK VERSION IS AN IDENTITY, NOT A COUNTER. `planPackUpdates` re-fetches a
// pack directory only where `installed < canon`, so the number is the fleet's
// whole name for a set of bytes. Two changes landing under one number means the
// members that converged between the two merges hold the first one's tree
// stamped with a number the second one also claims — and no converge will ever
// correct them, because their stamp already reads as current.
//
// That is not a hypothetical, and it is not an authoring mistake `pack-version-bumped`
// could have caught. Two branches cut from the same main both bump to the same
// next version, both record their row, both go green — each answered "did THIS
// change move the version" correctly and yes — and `pack.mjs` then AUTO-MERGES,
// because the two sides wrote identical bytes. Git has nothing to flag. #1482 is
// what it cost: #1466's janitor rule widening reached no member, the fleet swept
// with the old code, and the members' stamps read exactly as they should.
//
// THE ENGINE HAS NO TWIN OF THIS. `engine-release-record` (the claudinite local
// pack) is `pack-version-bumped`'s sibling, but the engine tree vendors WHOLESALE
// on every converge — its version records what landed, it does not gate what
// ships — so two releases sharing a number strand no content and there is nothing
// here to widen onto `engine/RELEASES.md`.
//
// THE DELIVERY half of that is `ci-work-scope.mjs` judging a push onto main
// against what the branch held before it, which re-asks `pack-version-bumped`
// where both branches are visible and so catches the collision as it lands.
// This is the RECORD half, and it is not the same
// question: a collision that landed before that gate existed left no red run
// behind, only two rows, and "what did version N change?" has two answers for
// as long as they both stand.
//
// WORLD SCOPE, because two rows claiming one number is a property of the tree,
// not of any diff — neither branch wrote both. `pack-version-bumped` forces a
// row for every bump, so a collision always leaves one.
