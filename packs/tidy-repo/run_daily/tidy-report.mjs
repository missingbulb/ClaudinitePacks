// tidy-repo maintenance task: tidy-report — the per-repo reconciliation unit. After
// this repo's branch-cleanup / pr-assess / issue-triage units settle, it rewrites the
// standing tidy tracker to today's snapshot from their verdicts. Because the single-
// object workers only see their own object, this is where the repo-level picture is
// owned. order: 'tidy:report' — the orchestrator runs it after the repo's other tidy
// units (a per-repo mini-barrier — the only ordering in the plan).
