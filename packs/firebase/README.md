# firebase pack

Active when the repo has `firebase.json` at its root or one directory down (a Firebase project
root is the directory that holds `firebase.json`, not necessarily the repo root). Durable
practices for building on Firebase - Firestore
security-rules discipline (merge semantics, server-owned fields, default-deny), callable Cloud
Function patterns (verified-token identity, validation, transactional rate limits, batched
fan-out), testing without live infrastructure (pure-logic extraction, the rules emulator when rules
themselves are under test), and deploy layout (predeploy build hooks, committed project aliases).
Mostly prose - the two mechanical halves of the deploy layout are checks.

Environment separation and store gating are the release standard, and load only when a project is
planning one: [create-release-plan](skills/create-release-plan/SKILL.md) — two fully separate
dev/prod projects with everything committed pointing at dev, prod config injected by the release
pipeline alone, and App Check attestation so only store-installed builds reach the prod backend.
No project has run a release through it yet, so expect it to move once one does.

## Rules (`RULES.md`)

The five always-on rules — what a session must know whether or not it opens a rules file or a
function:

| Rule | Severity | Reason | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin-SDK code bypasses rules | critical | correctness | prose: <50 words |
| Identity comes from the verified token | critical | correctness | prose: <20 words |
| Validate inputs at the boundary | critical | correctness | prose: <50 words |
| Extract decision logic into pure modules | medium | complexity | prose: <50 words |
| Cross-language contracts get mirrored test vectors. | high | correctness | prose: <50 words |

The security-rules discipline (default-deny, merge semantics, absent-field guards, server-owned
fields, `request.time` pins, bounded strings, empirical rules tests) is the
[`firestore-security-rules`](skills/firestore-security-rules/SKILL.md) skill, forced for
`**/firestore.rules` and `**/storage.rules`; the function-side limits (transactional rate limits,
batch chunking, best-effort push, the entrypoint smoke-load) are
[`firebase-functions`](skills/firebase-functions/SKILL.md), forced for `functions/**`; and the
deploy layout (a self-contained project root, committed `.firebaserc` aliases) joins
[`create-release-plan`](skills/create-release-plan/SKILL.md), forced for `firebase.json` and
`.firebaserc`.

## Checks

Both are relevance-first: they say nothing until `firebase.json` declares a functions codebase
whose `package.json` is in the checkout, so a rules-only or hosting-only Firebase repo hears from
neither. `firebase/functions-node-pin` demands `engines.node` in each declared codebase's
`package.json`; `firebase/functions-predeploy-build` demands that a codebase with a `build` script
wires that build as a `predeploy` hook in `firebase.json`.

| Check | Severity | Reason | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `firebase/functions-node-pin` | high | correctness | check: blocking |
| `firebase/functions-predeploy-build` | high | correctness | check: blocking |

## Skills

| Skill | Trigger |
|---|---|
| [`firestore-security-rules`](skills/firestore-security-rules/SKILL.md) | any edit of `firestore.rules` or `storage.rules` — held by the guard until loaded |
| [`firebase-functions`](skills/firebase-functions/SKILL.md) | any edit under `functions/` — held by the guard until loaded |
| [`create-release-plan`](skills/create-release-plan/SKILL.md) | planning a release, splitting dev/prod, wiring prod config or App Check; any edit of `firebase.json` or `.firebaserc` — held by the guard until loaded |
