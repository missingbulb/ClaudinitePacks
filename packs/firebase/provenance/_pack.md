## 2026-07-08 · born · Add executable-requirements pack; fill the flutter pack stub (#165)
- **Source:** missingbulb/ShoutsAndWhispers, a Firestore + Functions + FCM app with Google sign-in.
  The evidence names the project for the set of rules rather than one per rule.
- **Reason:** one project had exercised Firebase across rules, functions, messaging and deploy far
  enough for the practices to read as portable, so the pack was written filled rather than
  registered as a stub. Environment separation - the dev/prod split, App Check, store gating - was
  deliberately kept out: it is a decision a project takes once, when shipping gets close, and it
  landed beside this as the opt-in firebase-release pack instead.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Fable 5, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** the pack manifest, fingerprinted by a `firebase.json` at the repo root - the one
  config every Firebase repo carries.
- **Landed:** #165 (Closes #180) · pack version 1.

## 2026-07-08 · policy-changed · the fingerprint matches a firebase.json one directory down (#190)
- **Source:** missingbulb/ShoutsAndWhispers, which had just moved its Firebase files into
  `firebase/` and went undetected.
- **Reason:** a Firebase project root is the directory holding `firebase.json`, not necessarily the
  repo root - the CLI walks up to find the file and resolves every path inside it relative to that
  file, so a dedicated subfolder needs no config edits and is a legitimate common layout. Matching
  at the root only left such a repo needing a per-repo acceptance to stay honest. One directory down
  and never deeper is the bound, so a fixture or example tree cannot trip detection; flutter and
  node already fingerprinted that way.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** `detect` on the pack manifest, matching `firebase.json` at depth one or two.
- **Landed:** #190 · pack version 1.

## 2026-08-20 · merged · the firebase-release pack is absorbed here (#1081)
- **Reason:** the release standard stops being a declaration a repo adds and becomes a skill of this
  pack; the reasoning is on the create-release-plan entry of this date. The collapse goes through
  the engine's rename map and a declaration-converging record, so a member that declared the
  absorbed pack resolves to this one.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #1081 (Closes #1079) · pack version 4.

## 2026-09-01 · reaffirmed · the rationale #467 cut is recovered into a references file (#1575)
- **Reason:** mining every commit that shrank a still-standing canon rule found 49 shrink events, 43
  on rules that still stand, and they resolved to one genuine seam: #467. Six of this pack's rules
  had lost a clause carrying a failure mode, a cost or a frequency claim - something a review can
  weigh - and recovering it does not undo the owner's decision but completes it, since no reference
  file existed to hold it in July 2026. Every rule line stays exactly as #467 left it.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** a `references.md` beside the prose, each entry keyed from the rule it explains.
- **Landed:** #1575 (Closes #1571) · pack version 60901.1.

## 2026-09-03 · reworded · Every pack's RULES.md carries rules, not a description of the pack (#1634)
- **Reason:** the file opened with a paragraph saying what the pack covers, where it was earned and
  where the release standard lived. It changes nothing a session does, every session in every
  declaring repo paid for it, and the README and the manifest's `ruleRoutingGuidance` already
  carried it. Across the corpus the sweep took non-rule prose from 2,900 words to 1,080.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #1634 (Closes #1632) · pack version 60902.1.

## 2026-09-05 · moved · the prose file shrinks to the five always-on rules (#1667)
- **Reason:** every rule whose moment a file edit predicts left for one of the three skills, so what
  remains in `RULES.md` is what a session must know whether or not it opens a rules file or a
  function: the Admin-SDK bypass, token identity, boundary validation, pure decision modules and
  mirrored cross-language vectors.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Fable 5.1, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** three path-forced skills beside a five-rule prose file.
- **Landed:** #1667 (Closes #1662) · pack version 60903.2.

## 2026-09-25 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` rises to 60925.1
- **Reason:** this pack's checks declare `on_fail`, which an older engine does not read; the pack
  update holds this version until the member's engine is at 60925.1.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces.

## 2026-09-27 · born · a pitch paragraph for the dashboard's plain-repo view
- **Reason:** the dashboard shows a repo that does not run Claudinite the packs that fit it, and the
  owner asked for one paragraph per pack naming its main skills and process gains, with rough counts
  so it outlives the pack's growth.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `pitch` field, beside `ruleRoutingGuidance`.

## 2026-09-27 · scope-changed · the fingerprint is a `relevanceDetector` spec, not a function
- **Reason:** the owner asked for fingerprints a reader holding only GitHub's API can judge cheaply
  - a tree listing, a code search, then only the files that search names - which a function over a
  synchronous `read` cannot offer.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `relevanceDetector` (engine/pack_loader/relevance-detector.mjs): `paths`, optional `text`,
  `search` terms; it answers exactly what the retired `detect` answered, proven over 4,000 composed
  repos before the change.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the fingerprint's patterns are written as source strings
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data cannot hold a RegExp; each pattern is its source string, or {
  source, flags } where it carries a flag, and loads to the same RegExp.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the manifest becomes pack.json
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data is read with no import and by any tool; the conversion wrote
  the module's evaluated export, and the pack loads identically.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** pack.json, which the loader prefers over pack.mjs; a canon pack now needs engine
  60928.1, the first to read it.

## 2026-10-04 · scope-changed · the version takes the <major>.<day>.<n> form
- **Reason:** pack versions follow the Engine's `<major>.<day>.<n>` scheme; an index sorts every
  earlier version below one in that form, so this one outranks what the pack store already holds.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking that pack versions follow the same scheme.
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5.5
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `version`, which the release now requires in this form for a new
  version. firebase 1.61004.1.

## 2026-10-05 · retired · the Node engine's migration records leave the pack
- **Reason:** `migrations/` held records only the Node engine's updater ran; cn reads none of them,
  and no member of the new engine carries the shapes they converted.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking that ClaudinitePacks keep only code still needed.
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5.5
- **Mechanism:** the `migrations/` directory, deleted. firebase 1.61005.1.

## 2026-10-05 · scope-changed · routing no longer names the store-release packs
- **Reason:** `app-store-release` and `play-store-release` were stubs no repository declared, and
  the owner deleted them with `hello`; an `excludes` naming them routed to nothing.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking that hello, app-store-release and play-store-release be deleted.
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5.5
- **Mechanism:** `ruleRoutingGuidance.excludes` in the manifest. firebase 1.61005.1.
