# canon-curation

The canon's own curation duties — the fleet-facing work only the **Claudinite home repo** runs:
promoting members' lessons into the shared canon, and sweeping the corpus's prose backlog into
checks. A **home-only pack**: `detect: null`, never seeded by `--init` or any migration, declared
by hand in exactly one repo — the canon home itself.

**Declaration cardinality is the mechanism.** A pack's `run_daily` tasks run once per *declaring*
repo, so a pack only the home repo declares yields exactly one unit per task per night — "central,
once" with no bespoke orchestrator step. Each gate double-locks that with the planner's `isHome`
signal, so a stray declaration elsewhere can't double-run the canon's work. Un-declaring the pack
freezes canon absorption without touching the members' side ([grow_with_claudinite](../grow_with_claudinite/README.md)).

| Task | Runs when | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|
| `growth-promote-to-claudinite` | a participating member changed in the window (weekly full: all participants) | a PR against Claudinite's `main` |
| `prose-to-checks-sweep` | the home repo's weekly full sweep | a PR against Claudinite's `main` |

- **[promote.md](promote.md)** — the growth lifecycle's central stage: read the changed members'
  local docs, **generalize** the portable lessons, route each to the right canon home, and open a
  PR for the owner to approve. When a portable lesson's technology has no pack home, it mints a
  fingerprinted **stub pack** (in its own dedicated PR). This is the sole judgment gate before
  shared canon.
- **[item-routing.md](item-routing.md)** — the shared worthiness + routing method promote (and any
  other caller — the prose-to-checks sweep, an on-demand "learned lessons" pass) defers to, so
  every decision about admitting and placing an item is made the same way.
- **[promote-scope.mjs](promote-scope.mjs)** — the CI write-surface gate on promote's PRs: promote
  may write only under `packs/` and `skills/` (keyed on the `growth-promote` branch prefix).
- **prose-to-checks sweep** — the weekly backlog pass (worker: [the prose-to-checks
  skill](../../skills/prose-to-checks/SKILL.md), which this pack owns and mounts at home): mine the
  corpus's **existing** prose for always-testable rules the conversion missed and convert the
  strongest ones. Promote descends the ladder for each *new* lesson; this works the *backlog*, so
  the corpus keeps shedding context over time.

## The growth lifecycle — three independent stages, no barriers

How a lesson is learned in a consuming project, lifted into the shared canon when it's portable,
and pruned back out of the project once the canon owns it. Two packs split it by who declares them:
**[grow_with_claudinite](../grow_with_claudinite/README.md)** (member-side: extract + dedup + pack
discovery, seeded, opt-out by removal) and **canon-curation** (this pack, the central stage).

```
EXTRACT   per member    → commits directly to the member's main       (grow_with_claudinite)
PROMOTE   central, once → PR against Claudinite's main                (canon-curation)
DEDUP     per member    → PR against the member's main                (grow_with_claudinite)
```

All three are ordinary, **independent** planner units — there is no barrier and no phase ordering.
Each stage reads only what is already **merged**: promote processes whatever sits on members' mains
when it runs, so a lesson extracted tonight is promoted **tomorrow** night (the extract commit
trips the next night's signals), and reaches other members' dedup once the promote PR is approved
and merged. That approval was always the dominant latency, so the barrier machinery bought little;
if the cadence ever matters, promote can run more often (twice daily, or before and after the
nightly) without any design change.

**Review gates by blast radius, not uniformly.** Promote opens a PR — it's the sole judgment gate
before the shared canon every repo reads, so it always needs a human eye. Dedup opens a PR too — a
wrongful prune deletes a real local lesson. Extract commits directly to the member's `main` — it
writes only that project's own local docs, and the owner has opted out of a per-run PR to keep the
fleet's daily lesson-capture from flooding review requests. (The owner's on-demand, in-session
"learned lessons" command still delivers a PR — see
[extracting-lessons.md](../../skills/lessons-learned/extracting-lessons.md).)

**Central execution, no plumbing.** Promote runs from the Claudinite home repo with a fleet-wide
token, so it reads every participating member and opens its canon PR directly here — no
consumer-side Action, no cross-repo PAT, no labelled-issue up-path. The planner hands its gate the
`fleetMembers` aggregate (which members changed, and what they declare), and the gate hands the
worker the changed participants as `targets`.

The session-scoped sibling of this nightly lifecycle — mining a single working session for lessons
— lives with the [lessons-learned skill](../../skills/lessons-learned/extracting-lessons.md), and
the member-side method docs (extract, dedup, pack discovery, and how a project's local docs are
identified) live with [grow_with_claudinite](../grow_with_claudinite/README.md).
