// Pack independence: a pack's code imports only its OWN files and the engine
// surface (the engine roots plus the packs/-and-skills/-root machinery —
// checks/lib/imports.mjs owns that definition). Another pack's abilities
// arrive by DECLARING the dependency — `requires` on the pack manifest — and
// passing configuration; a helper both sides need moves into checks/lib. A
// pack must never import another pack's code, and never a canon-internal tree
// (migrations/, routines/): the vendor set ships a pack only when declared and
// ships no canon-internal tree at all, so such an import crashes every
// consumer that vendors the importer without its target (the failure the gated
// vendored-mount flip aborts on).
//
// A CANON-HOME constraint, so it lives in the canon's own curation pack: the
// artifact it polices — the corpus's packs/ tree — exists only in this repo,
// and no consumer needs the rule to use the corpus (a consumer's tree carries
// vendored packs the sweep never scans). The vendor writer's coherence guard
// (mount/vendor.mjs) backstops the same invariant at vendoring time.
//
// Scope: code references (import/require specifiers in non-test .mjs files
// that RESOLVE to a real file — the tree-oracle discipline). Prose naming a
// pack stays free: docs legitimately talk about packs; code coupling is the
// class that crashes.
