# grow_with_claudinite

Opt into the **growth lifecycle** — declaring this pack enrolls a repo in contributing its hard-won
lessons up to the shared Claudinite canon, and in pruning its local packs once the canon owns them.
Seeded by default (`--init` + the one-time `grow-with-claudinite-seed` baseline migration for the
existing fleet), and **opt-out by removal**: baselining never re-adds it.

The lifecycle's full narrative — the three stages, why there are no barriers between them, the
cadence, and the review gates — lives with its central stage, in the
[canon-curation pack](../canon-curation/README.md). This pack carries the **member-side** stages.

Its scheduled work is three `run_daily` tasks, all ordinary, independent planner units:

| Task | Runs when | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|
| `growth-extract-new-instructions` ([extract.md](extract.md)) | the project changed in the window | the project's own local packs, on `main` (directly) |
| `growth-dedup-local-instructions` ([dedup.md](dedup.md)) | canon changed, or the project's local packs changed (or weekly) | a PR against the project's `main` |
| `growth-discover-packs` ([discover-packs.md](discover-packs.md)) | the member's weekly full sweep | one PR per authored pack, against Claudinite's canon |

The central stage — `growth-promote-to-claudinite`, which reads the enrolled members' local packs,
generalizes the portable lessons, and opens a PR against Claudinite's canon — is **not** this
pack's: it rides [canon-curation](../canon-curation/README.md), declared only by the canon home
repo, and its gate targets exactly the members that declare *this* pack. A member that wants the
local stages without contributing upstream **opts out of promotion** on its own entry —
`{ "id": "grow_with_claudinite", "config": { "promote": false } }` — and the promote gate skips
it (absent or `true` = participate).

## The conversation lifecycle — capture at merge, extract nightly, retention

The pack also owns **extraction from working sessions** — the conversation-side sibling of the
issues/PRs/commits extract above, replacing the old in-session post-merge lessons pass:

1. **Capture — a step in the merge-to-main skill.** Right after a merge lands:
   `node .claudinite/shared/packs/grow_with_claudinite/capture-log.mjs --issue <n>`
   (in the canon repo itself: `node packs/grow_with_claudinite/capture-log.mjs --issue <n>`).
   Deterministic, seconds; it bundles the session transcript (sidechains inline, timestamp
   order), **scrubs enumeration-first** (every value the environment holds — `process.env`
   minus a short named allowlist of structural values, plus known credential stores — is
   redacted wherever it appears, with credential-shape patterns as the backstop; a secret the
   session itself transformed is beyond any static scrub, and push protection is the last
   net), and pushes one file per merge onto the orphan **`conversation-logs`** branch:
   `<stamp>--issue-<n>--<session>.jsonl`, commits marked `[skip ci]`. **Delta-aware:** a
   session that merges twice pushes a second, disjoint file for the second merge's issue.
   The branch is a **work queue, not an archive** — never merged; tips are cheap in shallow
   session clones and retention keeps them bounded.
2. **Fresh pass — the [conversation-extract nightly](conversation-extract.md)**, within a day:
   apply [extracting-lessons.md](extracting-lessons.md) (the method — friction signals and the
   measured efficiency analysis, computable from the log's timestamps and token usage), route
   keepers into the local packs, and post the rendered dialogue
   ([render-dialogue.mjs](render-dialogue.mjs)) on the worked issue for each rule that landed —
   **extraction is the only path to permanence**: a log that yields no rule gets no comment,
   and its conversation is gone once retention deletes it (a deliberate owner call).
3. **Final pass and deletion** — once a log ages past `config.retention_days`, the same nightly
   re-reads it with ~a week of hindsight (the rethink window), then deletes it. Every log gets
   exactly two judgment passes. **Unset retention = the sweep deletes nothing** (capture-only,
   fail-safe).

### Adopting the conversation lifecycle

The adoption interview asks for the two settings: an explicit `retention_days` (10
recommended), and where the nightly is scheduled — it is deliberately **not** a fleet
`run_daily` task (it needs local git in the repo's own context), so each repo schedules its own
thin launcher:

> Run the conversation extract exactly as specified in
> `.claudinite/shared/packs/grow_with_claudinite/conversation-extract.md`, from this repo's
> checkout.

## Rules

| Rule | Kind | What |
|---|---|---|
| `growth-config` | hardcoded ([config-check.mjs](config-check.mjs)) | entry config shape valid |

**Pack discovery** ([discover-packs.md](discover-packs.md)) is an ordinary `run_daily` task — the
planner picks it up per member on its weekly full sweep. For the member it's handed it runs the
whole pipeline: manifest the stack, suggest a pack for each technology no pack yet owns (on first
sight), populate it with rules and checks distilled from that member's real usage, and open one
canon PR per pack. Like every worker it **executes centrally** (home session, fleet token) — that's
how it writes the canon — but it's scheduled the regular way; over a week the staggered full sweep
covers the fleet, and the shelf + open-PR check keeps first sight from double-authoring.

## Identifying a project's capture surface: its local packs (the same way in every stage)

Every growth stage operates on a project's **local packs** — the tracked packs a repo keeps under
`.claudinite/local_packs/<pack>/` (prose in `RULES.md`, checks in the pack's `rules`, activity
procedures as the pack's skills, `run_daily` tasks). That subtree **is** the project's own content;
the rest of `.claudinite/` is the **read-only mounted canon** and is never a capture, prune, or
promote target. So "a project's local packs" means precisely *everything under
`.claudinite/local_packs/`, and nothing else under `.claudinite/`*. This is the normalized capture
surface — a structural set the stages read the same way, not a `CLAUDE.md`-graph walk over stray
Markdown (a repo with no local packs yet simply has nothing to extract, dedup, or promote here; a
project adopts the structure via the `generate-project-instructions` skill).

Prefer the strongest mechanism the lesson allows — the **local promotion ladder**, applied at the
project's own level: a deterministic rule becomes a **check** in the owning pack's `rules` (its
failure message carries the lesson), an activity-scoped procedure becomes a **pack skill**, and only
what neither can carry lands as **prose** in a pack's `RULES.md`. A check relieves every session's
context completely where prose only relocates it, so capture writes *more checks and less prose*.

The stages differ only in *how they read that set*, never in *which set it is*: extract and dedup
run against the member repo and read the local packs from the working tree; promote runs centrally
and reads the same subtree over the GitHub API (get-file-contents under `.claudinite/local_packs/`).
Extract writes into it, promote reads from it, dedup prunes within it — all against the identical,
`.claudinite/local_packs/`-rooted set.
