## 2026-08-12 · born · Claudinite growth: discover canon pack web-scraping (#739)
- **Source:** the #717 fleet sweep, which found three members taking data from a site they don't own
  (EdFringeNow's GraphQL scraper, EdFringeAllocator's hydration-blob fetcher and
  GoogleCalendarEventCreator's extractor pipeline), and no canon pack homing the facet.
- **Reason:** every line of the pack traces to a named member's real files; the two rules resting on
  a single member were flagged rather than dropped.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Opus 5, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** the pack manifest, with no `detect` and no `marker`: declaration is authoritative.
  A scraper is ordinary HTTP client code in whatever language the project already uses, and the same
  call sites appear in any project talking to an API it *does* own, so every candidate signature
  suspects the pack in repos that want nothing to do with it.
- **Rejected:** checks, and a fingerprint. Every rule here is about a *remote* service's behaviour
  (which field is authoritative, whether an instant is UTC, when a 200 is a bot wall), none of it
  written into repo state in a shape a deterministic check could read without firing on ordinary
  HTTP code. Prose plus one skill instead: the one-off reconnaissance procedure has a nameable
  trigger, so it descends to a skill rather than sitting in always-loaded prose.
- **Landed:** #739 (Refs #717) · pack version 1.

## 2026-08-23 · reworded · Pack manifests by convention: the tree declares the pack (#1248)
- **Reason:** the manifest stops restating its own tree (`id`, `prose`, `badge`, `skills`,
  `worldRules` and `workRules` resolve from the pack directory), and an absent `detect`/`marker` now
  *means* no fingerprint, so this pack's declaration-only stance is carried by absence rather than
  by an explicit `null`.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #1248 · pack version 60822.1.

## 2026-09-03 · reworded · Every pack's RULES.md carries rules, not a description of the pack (#1634)
- **Reason:** the facet paragraph, the "a default to adapt, not a contract" line and the
  language-agnostic note left `RULES.md`; the README already carries them, and every session in
  every declaring repo paid for them in always-loaded prose.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Landed:** #1634 · pack version 60902.1.

## 2026-09-25 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` rises to 60925.1
- **Reason:** this pack's checks declare `on_fail`, which an older engine does not read; the pack
  update holds this version until the member's engine is at 60925.1.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces.

## 2026-09-27 · born · a pitch paragraph for the dashboard's plain-repo view
- **Reason:** the dashboard shows a repo that does not run Claudinite the packs that fit it, and the
  owner asked for one paragraph per pack naming its main skills and process gains, with rough counts
  so it outlives the pack's growth.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `pitch` field, beside `ruleRoutingGuidance`.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the manifest becomes pack.json
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data is read with no import and by any tool; the conversion wrote
  the module's evaluated export, and the pack loads identically.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** pack.json, which the loader prefers over pack.mjs; a canon pack now needs engine
  60928.1, the first to read it.

## 2026-10-03 · scope-changed · the first version on the cn floor
- **Reason:** `60928.1` named a Node engine version, which `cn` read only as the legacy two-part
  form; with that tolerance retired (ClaudiniteEngine#18) a two-part entry is one `cn` skips, so
  the pack's newest version names `61001.1.0`, the floor every ported pack names. Nothing in the
  pack runs, so no higher floor is a claim anything tests.
- **Actor:** build lead, ClaudinitePacks#30 T1.
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces. web-scraping 61003.1.

## 2026-10-04 · scope-changed · the version takes the <major>.<day>.<n> form
- **Reason:** pack versions follow the Engine's `<major>.<day>.<n>` scheme; an index sorts every
  earlier version below one in that form, so this one outranks what the pack store already holds.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking that pack versions follow the same scheme.
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5.5
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `version`, which the release now requires in this form for a new
  version. web-scraping 1.61004.1.
