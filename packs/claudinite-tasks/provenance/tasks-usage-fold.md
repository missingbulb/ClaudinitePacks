## 2026-09-15 · born · Measure the machinery: run-cost records and the tasks-usage fold (#2046)
- **Source:** link M1 of #1869, against the ask in #1872.
- **Reason:** the queue had never known what it costs to run - how often the scheduler and the
  executor ran, what those runs were billed, what they spent in API calls and wall time, and how
  long an occurrence took to travel from a tick to a converged item. It is the machinery's own
  past-data plane, kept beside the session fold's rather than inside it. Every tier is appended
  once, because every source is a watermarked REST listing rather than a file re-read for free, so a
  counting fix applies forward only; the week tier drops the per-run map, whose keys would grow the
  file a row a week with nothing pruning it. Where the pack config carries no Actions minute rate
  there is no spend key anywhere, never a zero, and the rate a file was priced at is written beside
  the numbers so a later rate cannot silently re-price frozen rows.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** a task with no agent and a code-work worker delivered through the generated-file
  lane, gated on a precondition reading the fold's own watermark against the scheduler's most recent
  anchor - the mark's own movement, and no API call, which matters on a term asked at every tick. No
  built-in movement term can see the machinery: they all read the project's commits, issues, pull
  requests and captures, and a repo whose only activity is its own queue is silent by all four.
- **Landed:** #2046 (Refs #1869, #1872; it closes nothing by design, since #1872's own converge owns
  its state and #1869 is a tracking issue) · pack version 60915.4.
