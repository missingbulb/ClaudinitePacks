//
// What it models faithfully: virtual time; the scheduler run as a STATELESS
// loop (decision §15.33) — at every tick it asks every task ON THE SCHEDULE
// (one stating a condition, none of which reads the item itself; a task stating
// none runs only from an item somebody created, at whose pick an empty
// expression holds), through the task's own preconditions: the run-history
// terms first (`due:`, `last-run-over:`, `last-run-not-failed`), judged over
// the task's own items in the issue store, then the scenario's precondition
// function standing for every other condition; a yes files a READY item, a no
// is a log line and nothing else, a read the scheduler cannot make fails OPEN —
// and the engine's one invariant, ONE LIVE ITEM PER TASK, with the F16 dedupe
// of live duplicates; readiness; adoption; the executing-leash reclaim), the
// executor loop (pick order, same-title mutex, the `schedule_after` yield,
// claim, validate, the pick-time re-evaluation over the item's OWN facts — a
// woken item satisfies the cadence terms — whose no-go CLOSES the item, the
// work step/hand-off/converge as timed phases, heartbeat comments during the
// work step so the leash measures executor death rather than work duration),
// at-most-once invocation (one call per item, never retried — the
// fired/refused/unanswered trichotomy of DESIGN §6.6), readiness as the
// scheduler run's alone (F1, reopened 2026-08-15, then reversed 2026-08-26 /
// #1373), the janitor's stale-ready escalation, and the force lever (waking
// where an item exists, minting where none does — both stamped `Woken`, which
// is what the cadence terms read at pick).
//
// The engine keeps NO memory of an ask: there is no schedule board, no
// watermark, no first-window booking and no migration here because there is
// none in `queue/scheduler-run.mjs` — a decline is asked again at the next
// tick, and the only record of one is the `ask` log entry this model writes for
// the line the real run prints.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT model is inventoried in README.md's "The
// unsimulated world" — one row per boundary (cron delivery, list freshness,
// label non-atomicity, comment-id ordering, event delivery, secrets, …) with
// what defends the design there. A bug living exactly on one of those
// boundaries will not surface here; executor contention IS modeled, as
// stale-snapshot races over the claim protocol (raceExecutorsAt).
//
// Time is milliseconds UTC; events run strictly in time order (FIFO within a
// tie). Nothing here sleeps, threads, or reads the wall clock.
