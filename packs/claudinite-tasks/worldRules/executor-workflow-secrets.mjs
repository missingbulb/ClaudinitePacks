// A secret reaches a task only if the executor workflow names it STATICALLY — that
// is Actions' rule, and the reason the wiring converge stamps one env line per
// declared secret rather than one `toJSON(secrets)` (converge-workflows.mjs says why
// the cheap shape is not available). But `.github/workflows/` is the one directory a
// member's converge may not push to, so that file is scaffolded once at adoption and
// never regenerated: every task and every invocation endpoint added afterwards
// declares a secret the executor still does not carry.
//
// Nothing catches the drift. The declaration is valid, the queue picks the item up,
// the run starts, and only then does the worker read `process.env.<NAME>` as
// undefined — an endpoint invocation says so (queue/invoke.mjs), and code-work that
// reads its own secret may not say anything at all. NoRFinder ran that way: an
// endpoint declaring `tokenSecret: CCR_ROUTINE_TOKEN` against an executor whose
// secrets list was empty.
//
// ADVISORY, DELIBERATELY, for `conformance-workflow`'s reason: the remedy is a
// human-merged PR to `.github/workflows/`, the one fix a member's own machinery
// cannot make. Blocking would turn such a member red with no move of its own to
// clear it, every night, until a person happened to look.
//
// The expectation is COMPUTED FROM THE SAME TWO SOURCES the converge reads
// (`secretNames`) over the same walk discovery makes (`taskDeclarationFiles`), so
// this cannot hold a second opinion of what the file should say. Extra names in the
// workflow are not a finding: a member that dropped a task keeps a harmless line.
