# Per-project maintenance scheduling — design

Status: **agreed** (owner decisions recorded in §11; revised per owner review on
PR #391). Supersedes, once migrated, the central fleet routine
([`routines/auto-all-repos-maintenance.md`](../../../../routines/auto-all-repos-maintenance.md)
and its external CCR trigger) and the two out-of-band GCEC CCR triggers.
The phased rollout lives in [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md). Refs #390.

The shape: every repo schedules **itself** — a vendored hourly **scheduler Action**
evaluates task preconditions and dispatches agent work as `ready-for-agent` issues;
a per-repo **executor routine**, fired by that label event, executes them. Work that
is genuinely fleet-scoped becomes ordinary tasks *of the canon repo* on the same
machinery — no separate central mechanism survives.

> **Revised (owner, 2026-08-06) — the three-responsibility split.** This record

## 1. Task anatomy — the pack folder

`run_daily/` is superseded by `tasks/`, one directory per task, in canon packs
and local packs alike:

```
packs/<pack>/tasks/<task-name>/
  task.mjs        # declaration + precondition — self-contained, importable standalone
  task.md         # the worker spec the agent executes; the dispatch issue's first line points here
  *.sh, *.js      # optional deterministic helper scripts (the routine-folder convention, absorbed)
```

> **As-built (Phase 0, #396):** `tasks/` lands **additively** — a canon pack
> carries both `tasks/` and its untouched `run_daily/` through the rollout, so
> the legacy central planner keeps working while the scheduler discovers `tasks/`
> from disk (`pack.mjs` is not touched). `run_daily/` is removed only at Phase 4.
> The two conformance guards for this shape (`task-declaration-shape`,
> `scheduler-workflow-shape`) live in the **basics** pack, not a separate one —
> scheduling is baseline discipline (see
> [`packs/claudinite-growth/skills/writing-tasks/SKILL.md`](../../../../packs/claudinite-growth/skills/writing-tasks/SKILL.md)).

Alongside this migration, `.claudinite/local_packs/` is renamed to
`.claudinite/local/packs/` (owner decision, §11): packs then sit at one uniform
depth under a single scan root, `.claudinite/*/packs/`. The two valid task-file
prefixes in a consumer repo are exactly:

```
.claudinite/shared/packs/<pack>/tasks/<task>/task.md     (vendored canon task)
.claudinite/local/packs/<pack>/tasks/<task>/task.md      (project-owned task)
```

The canonical local-pack declaration token becomes `local/<id>` (the legacy
`local_packs/<id>` and bare-id forms stay accepted, and baselining's
normalization rewrites them — same machinery as the 2026-07-19 namespace
migration).

`task.mjs` carries the whole contract:

```js
export default {
  id: 'growth-extract',
  frequency: 'daily-1h',   // hourly | daily-2h | daily-1h | daily | daily+1h | weekly | monthly | manual — nothing else
  precondition_signals: ['commits', 'prs', 'issues'],   // which parts of the signals object to collect
  agent_model: 'opus',     // opus | sonnet | haiku | none — 'none' = pure code, no agent, no issue
  expected_outcome: 'merged-pr', // none | open-pr | merged-pr — the task's write ceiling (§4)
  agent_instructions: 'task.md',
  precondition(signals, config) {
    // Pure code over the collected signals + this pack's entry config from .claudinite-checks.json.
    // Decides "needs to run" AND emits binding context for the dispatch issue.
    return {
      run: true,
      reason: '2 substantive commits in window',
      context: ['Only PRs #12 and #15 are in scope. #13 is a bot bump — do not touch it.'],
    };
  },
}
```

- **`frequency`** — exactly the values above. `manual` is the one non-cadence
  (as-built 2026-08-11, #749): the task is never due on any schedule and runs only
  when a hand-started run forces it — the operator-lever shape, for work that
  answers no recurring question but wants the task apparatus (contract validation,
  code-work, the dispatch issue) when a human pulls it. `daily±Nh` offsets the repo's
  daily anchor hour (§2); weekly/monthly fire at the anchor hour on the configured day.
- **`precondition_signals`** — the scheduler collects only the union of what the *due* tasks
  declare; a non-daily slot never pays for daily tasks' signals.
- **`agent_model`** — family names, resolved to a concrete model id in **one** vendored
  module (`engine/scheduler/model-map.mjs`), so a model-generation bump is one
  edit. `none` replaces `smarts: 'none'`: the worker is an `.mjs` the scheduler
  runs inline — no issue, no agent.
- **`expected_outcome`** — a declared **ceiling**, not a promise: `none` may never open a
  PR, `open-pr` may open but never merge, `merged-pr` may arm auto-merge. "No
  change" is always a legal result. Enforced post-hoc by the executor in code,
  not just requested in prose. A repo whose `maintenance.delivery` is `review`
  degrades `merged-pr` tasks to `open-pr` — member config wins, and the task
  never reads the setting itself: the shared delivery helper does
  (`engine/scheduler/land-pr.mjs` for the code lane, its prose twin
  `engine/scheduler/deliver-pr.md` for executor subagents — §12.8). Pushes to
  non-default branches (e.g. the `conversation-logs` prune) are outside the
  taxonomy.
- **`precondition`** — today's `gate` renamed. It both asserts need-to-run and
  **pre-decides scope**: `context` lines land verbatim in the dispatch issue, and
  the executor treats them as constraints the agent may not re-litigate (if the
  precondition can rule a PR irrelevant in code, the agent never re-decides it).
  A precondition is cheap and local: decision logic and API reads/writes only —
  never network fetches of external pages, never long work.
- Per-task project settings ride the already-sanctioned container — the pack
  entry's `config` in `.claudinite-checks.json`. No new per-task engine keys.
- The self-contained-module rule carries over: `task.mjs` imports nothing, so
  scheduler, executor, and humans load it standalone. Local pack dir-name == id
  stays load-bearing.

## 2. Repo-level schedule settings

New top-level key in `.claudinite-checks.json` (added to the engine's closed
`CONFIG_KEYS` set):

```json
"taskScheduler": { "dailyHour": 4, "weeklyDay": "Sun", "monthlyDay": 1 }
```

All values **UTC** (requirements normalize to UTC at the door). Defaults when
absent: `dailyHour: 4`, `weeklyDay: "Sun"`, `monthlyDay: 1`. `monthlyDay` clamps
to the month's last day; `daily-2h` with `dailyHour < 2` wraps into the previous
calendar day (the slot keeps the anchor's date). With the default anchor the four
daily slots stage the whole growth chain in order:

```
02:00  daily-2h   baselining (+ migrations-apply)   ─ own mount converged before anything reads it
03:00  daily-1h   extract (activity + conversation)  ─ lessons captured from a converged repo
04:00  daily      promote (canon repo)              ─ lifts the night's merged extracts to canon
Sun 04:00 weekly  dedup                             ─ prunes against the mounted (merged) canon
```

The stages couple through *merged* upstream state, not a barrier: extract's
auto-merge PR usually lands well within the hour before promote reads it, and
dedup reads only the merged/mounted canon (never an in-flight promote PR), so the
ordering is freshness staging that mostly holds and self-heals to next-day
propagation when a merge lags.

> **As-built (owner, 2026-08-01): the staging holds only while the fires do — so one task can
> take the run.** The hour between anchors is not a barrier, and it is not a
> guarantee either: a GitHub `schedule:` fire is dropped and delayed freely (see
> the `github-actions-scheduling` skill), and a run that fires at 05:40 after
> three dropped fires finds all four daily slots due at once. Every one of them
> dispatches together, so **baselining runs beside the tasks whose ground it

> freshness staging like the rest of the chain, it is the pass that converges the
> mount, the wiring and the migration notes the others then execute against.
>
> On those runs the ordering has to be asserted rather than implied. A
> precondition may return **`exclusive: true`** beside `run: true` — *if I run

> (§3, step 4). Baselining claims it exactly when the mount is genuinely overdue:
> more than a day since the last converge landed, and not more than three (past
> that the repo is wedged — an unmerged maintenance PR, a broken converge — which
> is a human's problem, and holding the rest of the repo back another night does
> not fix it). The routine same-day case claims nothing, so the common night is

>
> **A deferred slot is spent, not queued.** Due-ness is `slotTime ∈ (lastSuccess,

> rather than silent.

> **As-built (#582): dedup left the nightly chain for the weekly anchor.** It was

> which is a later day regardless.

## 3. The scheduler — one vendored hourly Action per repo

`.github/workflows/claudinite-scheduler.yml` (vendored stub, shape-enforced by a
conformance check): hourly cron on a **repo-hashed minute constrained to
:10–:50** (spreads the fleet, dodges GitHub's :00 stampede, and keeps clear of
the hour boundary the slot math anchors on), `workflow_dispatch` for manual
runs, a `concurrency` group serializing runs. The workflow itself is a thin shim
— all logic lives in the vendored engine, so the file under `.github/` changes
rarely (a property to preserve: schema and behavior changes ride the vendor
refresh, not workflow edits). It runs
`node .claudinite/shared/engine/scheduler/run.mjs`, which:

1. **Decides due slots statelessly from the run ledger GitHub already keeps.**
   For each frequency, compute the most recent scheduled slot time ≤ now from
   `taskScheduler`. Fetch the timestamp `T` of this workflow's last **successful** run
   (Actions API). A slot is due iff its time ∈ `(T, now]`.
   - Miss/outage → the next successful run catches up daily/weekly/monthly slots;
     no watermark file, nothing to corrupt.
   - Only the most recent slot per frequency is considered → a 3-day outage
     yields one catch-up evaluation, never a backfill storm.
   - **Hourly slots never catch up** (stale polls are worthless).
   - Late fire (15:02 for a ~15:00 slot) is irrelevant — due-ness is schedule
     math, never wall-clock equality.
   - No prior success (fresh adoption) → the most-recent slots of the **first-run
     set** are due: `hourly` plus the daily family, never weekly or monthly. The
     first run is an adoption smoke test, and the wiring it proves — discovery,
     signals, dispatch issue, label, executor pickup — is the same whatever the
     frequency, so the daily family exercises all of it. Adding weekly/monthly
     would only buy an off-anchor run of their unconditional tasks (open-web
     research, pack discovery, the fleet sweep) on the least-proven repo in the
     fleet; they wait for their real anchor, which is due normally once this run
     is in the ledger.
   - An **unreadable** ledger is not an empty one. `T = null` is a positive claim
     that the repo has never run, so the read returns it only for a 200 that
     found no successful run; a non-2xx (or a run record with no timestamp)
     throws and the run **fails**, evaluating nothing. Failing is free here —
     a failed run never enters the success ledger, so `T` stays put and the next
     successful run catches up the missed slots by the same outage rule above.
     An exit-0 abort would not be free: it would enter the ledger and advance `T`
     past the slots it declined to evaluate.
2. **Discovers tasks** with one uniform scan —
   `.claudinite/{shared,local}/packs/<p>/tasks/*/task.mjs` — activation-gated by
   the `packs` declaration exactly like checks and skills; filters to due
   frequencies.
3. **Collects signals** — only the declared union. Vocabulary (one collector
   module each; window = the task's period + 1h slack, stateless fixed lookback;
   overlap absorbed by dedupe):
   - `commits` — default-branch commits in window, `substantiveChange`
     classification, touched paths.
   - `prs`, `issues`, `branches` — open + touched-in-window. `branches` carries
     `touched` by reading each distinct tip sha's commit date (one read per tip;
     no REST branch listing carries a date), because before that it carried
     *names only* — leaving the branch dimension with no notion of newness and
     every gate over it degenerate to "a branch exists". An unreadable tip is
     `updatedAt: null`, never touched. Each open `prs` entry
     carries `changedPaths`, the PR's own pending file list (one read per open
     PR; no PR listing carries files, capped at 300 files), so a precondition can
     rule on what is waiting for review rather than on a marker somebody has to
     remember to apply — wiki-growth declines while a `product-wiki/` change is
     pending, a human's as much as its own. A read that failed is `null`, never
     `[]`: every PR changes a file, so unknown is a third state a path gate must
     decline on rather than read as clear. `prs` additionally
     carries `merged`, the PRs **merged during the window** (the review
     discussion behind a change is the richest lesson material there is, and it
     is closed by the time a window sees it). `merged` is a separate field, not
     folded into `open`/`touched`, so widening it cannot widen the target set of
     a task that sweeps the open PRs. Self-trigger exclusions carried over **and
     extended**: the housekeeping-commit regex, tracker titles, and now
     `[claudinite-task]` issues and `ready-for-agent` label events are invisible
     to signals.
   - `release` — latest GitHub release + manifest version.
   - `localPacks` — changed-in-window.
   - `sharedMount` — which *declared* packs' vendored files changed in the
     window. Replaces the cross-repo `relevantCanonChanged`: the member's own
     merged vendor-refresh commit is the local echo of "canon changed".
   - `conversationLogs` — logs branch present, oldest JSONL age vs retention.
   - `stamp` — the `claudinite.updated`/`ref` provenance stamp and its age;
     plus the canon head sha when the canon is readable from the Action
     (baselining's precondition falls back to stamp-age when it isn't).
   - `fleet` — canon repo only, over the fleet PAT (the members aggregate for
     the genuinely fleet-scoped tasks). Consumers cannot declare it.
   A **manual** `workflow_dispatch` run may additionally carry `overrides` — one
   free-form `KEY=value` string, since GitHub cannot declare arbitrary named
   inputs. It reaches the engine as `CLAUDINITE_OVERRIDES`, and the engine
   understands exactly one key: **`FORCE_TASKS=<comma-separated task ids>`**.
   A run carrying FORCE_TASKS evaluates **only** the forced tasks (as-built
   2026-08-11, #749) — never whatever else happened to be due at that minute, so a
   button that names specific work means the same thing whenever it is pressed, and
   a fleet fan-out firing twenty members' schedulers means exactly one task in each.
   The skipped due work is not lost: the success watermark counts **schedule-event
   runs only** (`lastSuccessTime`), so a slot a forced run stepped over stays due
   for the next cron. Each forced task runs under its most-recent slot **and runs
   without its precondition being consulted at all** *(as-built 2026-08-06: a
   forced dispatch's slot id carries a per-run marker, `<slot>~f<run-id>`, so the
   exactly-once guard never silently swallows an operator re-run of a slot the
   schedule already ran; at-most-one-open still applies)* — forcing is a decision the
   operator already made, so nothing asks the task whether it agrees, and no task
   declaration mentions forcing anywhere (#515). The engine learns "run these
   ids", never what any of them do. An id matching no discovered task forces
   nothing; a task due on its own merit is judged normally, not forced; and a
   forced dispatch carries a generic Context saying so, since its issue Context
   is the agent's binding scope and nothing here asserts there is work to do.

   The case it exists for is `FORCE_TASKS=baselining`: the age gate
   (`ageDays > 1`) means a repo that baselined this morning is not due again for
   over a day, so a canon fix worth propagating *today* otherwise had no lever
   short of hand-editing each repo's stamp. The two gates are why forcing has to
   live in the engine: the SLOT gate runs before any precondition, so an override
   a task read for itself was unreachable on exactly the mid-day run that needs
   it.

4. **Runs preconditions** — pure code, per-task try/catch isolation; a throwing
   precondition converges to the standard failure state (`report-failure`
   composite → `workflow-failure` issue); other tasks proceed. Every due task's
   verdict is computed **before** anything is dispatched, because of the next
   point: a claim on the run is only knowable once they have all spoken.

   A verdict may carry **`exclusive: true`** beside `run: true` — *if I run this
   cycle, I run alone* — and every other due task whose precondition said run is
   **deferred**: no preprocessing subprocess, no dispatch issue, no inline work
   (owner, 2026-08-01). It exists because the hourly cron is not hourly: a run that fires
   hours late finds several daily slots due at once and dispatches the whole
   nightly chain together, which puts baselining *beside* the tasks whose mount
   it exists to converge instead of an hour ahead of them (§2 as-built). The
   engine learns "this verdict claims the run", never which task claims it or
   why — the same separation `FORCE_TASKS` keeps, and the reason no engine module
   mentions baselining. Two claimants are not a conflict: they both run and
   everything else defers, so no priority order between packs is needed. A
   **forced** task is exempt from deferral and cannot claim (its verdict is the
   engine's, not the task's) — a claim swallowing the task the operator asked for
   would make a hand-started run do nothing it was started for.

   A deferred slot is **spent, not queued**: this run succeeds, so the watermark
   moves past it and the task runs again at its *next* slot (tomorrow, or next
   week). That cost is the point of bounding who may claim — see §2.
5. **Executes or dispatches** — `model: 'none'` → run the worker `.mjs` inline
   (which may itself dispatch and await another workflow); otherwise file the
   dispatch issue (§4) labeled `ready-for-agent`. A deferred task does neither.
6. **Reports** — the job summary lists every evaluated task with run/skip/reason
   (the observability `plan.json` used to give). Whole-run failure escalates per
   `gha/scheduled-failure-escalation`. Beside the prose, the run prints one
   **machine-readable record per evaluated task** — `claudinite-task-run v1
   <pack>/<task> [<slot>] <outcome>`, outcome ∈ `agent` / `preprocess` /
   `skipped` / `failed` / `deferred` (`run-record.mjs`, the single home of both
   the renderer and its parser). Printed *after* the action loop, so it states
   what happened rather than what was planned. Nothing in the scheduler reads it
   back — it exists so the usage aggregation can count task invocations without
   the scheduler acquiring state of its own (skill-usage-metrics DESIGN §4.2).

`fullSweep`, `full_sweep_supported`, and the hash-stagger retire: "weekly" is now
a declaration, not a gate trick. And the scheduler is **the only cron in the
repo** — the release workflow's independent 00:30 cron is absorbed into the
store-release task, so recurring work has exactly one trigger surface.

## 4. The dispatch issue — exactly-once, bounded, recoverable

- **Title**: `[claudinite-task] <pack>/<task> <slot-id>`; slot-id
  `h2026-07-22T14Z` (hourly), `d2026-07-22` (daily family), `w2026-07-19`
  (weekly, the slot's day), `m2026-07` (monthly).
- **Body** — first line is the task-file path; everything behavior-defining
  (model, outcome, worker content) is read from the tracked repo file, never
  from the issue:

  ```
  .claudinite/local/packs/gcec/tasks/create-extractor/task.md

  Execute the Claudinite task above (pack `gcec`, task `create-extractor`, slot `h2026-07-22T14Z`).
  The Context section below is binding scope — do not re-decide it.

  ### Context
  - Eligible requests: #123, #125. #124 is labeled extractor-blocked-needs-human — do not touch it.
  ```
- **Exactly-once per (task, slot)**: before creating, search issues state=**all**
  for the exact title; found → skip. Makes scheduler double-runs and
  crash-retries safe (`concurrency` serializes; the search closes the
  crashed-mid-run window).
- **At-most-one *live* issue per task**: an open `[claudinite-task] <pack>/<task>`
  issue (any slot) that is still live work — claimed (`agent-running`) or newly
  filed and about to be — suppresses new filings, so an executor outage
  accumulates zero backlog beyond one issue per task. An open dispatch issue older
  than ~2 of its periods gets an escalation comment + `needs-human` from the
  scheduler. *(As-built correction, #821: `needs-human` is a terminal awaiting a
  person, not live work, and suppressing on it stopped the task until someone
  closed the issue by hand — 13 tasks across 9 repos, the oldest for three weeks.
  A terminal no longer suppresses; the next slot files normally. The re-filing is
  bounded, because a durable cause escalates every slot: a second unresolved
  escalation holds the lane, under a verdict of its own so "a session is on it"
  and "shut, pending triage" are distinguishable in the run summary.)*
- **Lifecycle**: success → executor comments the result and closes it. Failure →
  comment naming what failed, remove `ready-for-agent`, add `needs-human`.
  Every exit converges to one visible triage state (the canon's
  failure-convergence rule — which also fixes create-extractor's current
  "trigger label never removed" gap).

## 5. The executor — a per-repo routine fired by the `ready-for-agent` label

One CCR routine per repo (owner decision, §11), created at bootstrap,
**triggered by the GitHub issue event of the `ready-for-agent` label being
applied** — not by a timer. The session starts when the scheduler labels the
issue, so dispatch latency is the session spin-up, minutes not hours, and no
sessions burn on empty hours.

- **Session model**: `sonnet` — the routine itself only orchestrates; each task
  runs as a **subagent at the task's declared model family** (how per-task model
  survives a single-model routine).
- **Launcher prompt** (thin pointer, per the unattended-agents rule):
  `Execute the Claudinite executor: .claudinite/shared/engine/scheduler/executor.md`.
- **Session sources** are the **member repo alone** (task-code-work DESIGN
  §7/E5). The executor no longer needs the canon checkout: baselining fetches
  PUBLIC canon **Action-side** in its `code_work` worker and reads
  migration notes from the member's own vendored mount, so a project-only session
  is all the ambient scope executor work requires. (Superseded the earlier model,
  where the canon rode in the session sources so the baselining task could run the
  canon's vendoring script directly.)
- **`executor.md`** (vendored, hyper-specific, MCP-only GitHub access):
  1. **The triggering issue is the session's *only* work item.** It never lists or
     processes another open `ready-for-agent` issue.

     This is the fix for the duplicate-execution bug. One scheduler run files every
     due task's dispatch issue seconds apart, each already labeled, so **one run
     emits one label event per issue and starts one session per event**. The
     original design paired that fan-out with a self-healing sweep in which every
     session also drained its siblings — so N dispatches produced N sessions each
     building the same N-issue work list. The step-3 claim could not save it: every
     session read the list before any of them claimed. Observed on 2026-07-26 —
     dispatch #427 run twice (#452), #425 run three times, leaving four duplicate
     tracker issues, three duplicate filings of one finding, and duplicate PRs
     making the same changes.

     One session, one issue: concurrency between sessions stays normal and becomes
     safe by construction. The recovery the sweep provided moves into deterministic
     scheduler code (below).

     Steps 1 and 2 are one command: `resolve-dispatch.mjs` does both, so neither
     the identification nor the validation depends on the session's judgment.

     **The trigger reaches the session by two transports, and both are read.**
     GitHub Actions writes the webhook payload to `$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` (number +
     label + body, one shot). Claude Code on the web writes no payload file and
     instead sets `CCR_TRIGGER_SOURCE` / `CCR_TRIGGER_EVENT` / `CCR_TRIGGER_REPO`
     / `CCR_TRIGGER_ISSUE_NUMBER`, which name the issue but carry neither its
     labels nor its body — so that path resolves in two shots (the
     `needs-issue` verdict, at exit 0 — the routine is mid-handshake, not
     stopped: the executor fetches that one issue over MCP, saves the raw
     response JSON verbatim, and re-invokes with `--issue-json`; the shell
     extracts body/labels/title itself and rejects a response for the wrong
     issue number — `--issue-body-file` / `--issue-labels` remain as the manual
     fallback). Reading only the Actions transport
     is what let the duplicate-execution bug back in: every CCR-run executor
     session missed its own trigger, fell through to the fallback, and selected
     an issue by listing. Observed 2026-07-28, dispatch #772 claimed twice one
     second apart.

     **There is no fallback, deliberately.** A session that cannot name its
     trigger runs *nothing* (exit 12) — it never selects a dispatch by listing the
     queue. That fallback was the same N-sessions-racing-over-N-issues failure as
     the sweep it replaced, reached from the other direction: every session that
     cannot identify its trigger builds the same work list, and the claim cannot
     save them because they all read the list before any of them claims. The
     scheduler's hourly re-arm is the recovery, in code, once.
  2. Deterministic validation in code, before any model judgment
     (`resolve-dispatch.mjs`, over `validate-dispatch.mjs`'s pure core): the body's
     first line matches
     `^(\.claudinite\/(shared|local)\/)?packs\/[^/]+\/tasks\/[^/]+\/task\.md$`,
     the file exists at HEAD, its pack is declared, its `task.mjs` sibling
     parses; prints the resolved model and outcome ceiling. The shell itself makes
     no GitHub call on either transport — the body arrives from the payload or
     from the executor's own MCP fetch — which is what keeps it runnable in the
     MCP-only, tokenless executor session. Exit codes are the interface: valid /
     invalid (comment + de-label + `needs-human`) / not-this-scope / needs-issue /
     no-trigger (stop).
  3. **Claim** the issue as a *verified lease*, since GitHub offers no
     compare-and-swap on labels: **read** the current labels and abandon if the
     ready label is gone or `agent-running`/`needs-human` is present; **swap**
     `ready-for-agent` → `agent-running` and post a claim comment; **re-read** and,
     if a second claim comment is present, let the earliest claim win and end the
     session without dispatching. The read-swap-*confirm* shape is what makes the
     claim meaningful — the original blind swap could not detect a lost race, and
     the missing third step is what let a duplicate through.
  4. Dispatch a subagent at the declared model: read `task.md`, follow it
     exactly; the issue's Context section is binding scope — never re-decide or
     widen it.
  5. Post-verify in code (`verify-outcome.mjs`): outcome ceiling respected (a
     `none` task that opened a PR, or an `open-pr` task that merged one, fails
     the run); then close the issue with a result comment, or converge the
     failure (comment + `needs-human`, remove `agent-running`).
  6. **No backstop sweeps.** Converging a dead `agent-running` claim, and
     re-arming a dispatch whose label event never landed, are the **scheduler's**,
     in code, once per hourly run — not the executor's. Sweeping them here meant
     every session triggered by the same run swept the same issues in parallel:
     the duplicate-work bug again, in miniature.

**The maintenance pass** — *superseded (owner, 2026-08-06): this recovery left
the scheduler and is now the daily `basics/task-janitor` task's worker (§12.1);
the scheduler creates dispatches and does nothing else to them. The pure rules
below are unchanged in `dispatch.mjs`* — was the single home for executor
recovery. Each run, after (originally) filing the cycle's dispatches:

  1. **Stale** — a dispatch open past ~2 of its own scheduling periods →
     escalation comment, drop the ready label, add `needs-human`
     (`staleDispatchIssues`; specified since the original design, but never
     actually wired into `main()` until now).
  2. **Dead claim** — `agent-running` with no activity for ~3h → comment, drop
     `agent-running`, add `needs-human` (`staleClaimedDispatchIssues`). Scoped to
     `[claudinite-task]` titles, so a task's claim on an issue *it* owns is never
     swept.
  3. **Re-arm** — armed, unclaimed, uncommented and past a 20-minute grace window
     → the trigger event was lost, so remove and re-add its own ready label to
     emit a fresh one (`rearmDispatchIssues`). Remove-then-add is load-bearing:
     re-applying a label already present emits no `labeled` event. A fleet
     dispatch re-arms under the fleet label, never the self one.

Stale wins over re-arm, so an issue converging to triage is never put back into
circulation; and stale is what bounds the re-arm loop when the executor is down
for good.

**Security** — this raises the bar; it is not a hard boundary. Applying a label
requires triage/write permission, so a drive-by issue filing can't summon the
agent — but anyone with write access, or a leaked token that can label, can.
The real containment is narrower and structural: the issue never carries
instructions. The executor only runs tracked, reviewed task files at
code-validated paths, and model/outcome come from the repo, not the issue — so
a forged dispatch at worst runs a legitimate task early, inside its declared
outcome ceiling.

**Creation at bootstrap**: the adopting session creates the label-wired routine
via the trigger API when available; otherwise it files an owner issue carrying
the exact routine config (trigger event, filter label, model, launcher prompt)
in one enclosed block — the only human action left in wiring a repo into
maintenance.

## 6. Where a task's own facts live

There is no inventory here. A task's frequency, signals, model, outcome ceiling
and the reasoning behind each are its `task.mjs` declaration and the comment
above it (§1) — one place, next to the code the scheduler actually reads. A
table restating them is a second copy that goes stale the first time a task is
retuned, and it grew a running history of every such retune besides. This design
owns the *mechanism*; `packs/<pack>/tasks/` owns which tasks exist.

## 7. Recoverability semantics (the message-semantics contract)

- **Scheduler miss** → next successful run catches up non-hourly slots (run-ledger
  due-ness). **Late/early fire** → irrelevant (schedule math). **Double run** →
  workflow `concurrency` + exactly-once issue per (task, slot) via state=all
  title search.
- **Missed label event / executor down** → the issue stays labeled and open; the
  scheduler's next run re-arms it, and escalates it to `needs-human` if it is
  still unrun past ~2 periods. **Duplicate label events on one issue** → the
  read-swap-confirm claim lease. **Several issues dispatched at once** → not a
  race at all: each session runs only its own issue. **Executor died mid-run** →
  the scheduler converges the stale `agent-running` claim to `needs-human`.
- Recovery lives in **one place, in code**. The rule it cost a duplicate-execution
  incident to learn: when a trigger fans out to N concurrent sessions, never also
  give each session a sweep over the shared work — every session will do every
  other session's work, and a claim taken after the work list is read cannot
  prevent it.
- **Precondition/signal crash** → per-task isolation + `workflow-failure` issue;
  the rest of the run proceeds.
- Not idempotence — recoverability: every anomaly lands in a visible, bounded,
  human-triageable issue state, and issue volume is capped by construction at one
  live dispatch issue per task plus the escalations awaiting triage, which
  themselves stop the lane once a second one goes unresolved (§4).

## 8. End state — everything that remains scheduled

1. **Per repo (identical, vendored)**: `claudinite-scheduler.yml` — **the only
   cron in the repo** — plus one label-fired executor routine (thin pointer to
   the vendored `executor.md`).
2. **Canon repo only**: the canon-curation tasks — ordinary tasks of that repo,
   some fleet-scoped by signal, none by mechanism.
3. **Deleted**: the "All Missing Bulb Repos - Daily Maintenance" CCR trigger,
   both GCEC CCR triggers, `routines/auto-all-repos-maintenance.md`,
   `routines/fleet/` (planner, registry, local-tasks, schedule, gates, signals),
   and the release workflow's independent cron.
4. **Unchanged**: Yestersummary (out of scope).

Doctrine rewrite: `scheduling.md`'s "one fleet schedule" becomes "one
**scheduler per repo** — the vendored hourly Action is the repo's only cron;
agent work is dispatched only through `ready-for-agent` issues; recurring work
that used to be its own cron'd workflow becomes a scheduler task, and that
workflow is deleted."

A competing cron is **not** retained as a dispatch-only workflow for a task to
fire. That shape keeps two files and two edit sites for one job, and leaves a
workflow whose only caller is the thing that replaced it — the task's worker is
where the steps belong. The one shape that legitimately survives is a workflow
that must run *as an Action* for something a task cannot reach (see
`store-release`, §7) — and even then the task owns the schedule, not the
workflow.

## 9. Bootstrap changes

Part 6 of `bootstrap.md` (the "Enroll <PROJECT> …" owner issue) is **replaced**.
Bootstrap now: (a) vendors the scheduler workflow, (b) writes `taskScheduler` defaults
into `.claudinite-checks.json`, (c) creates the label-wired executor routine via the
trigger API — or files the enclosed-config owner issue when the API isn't reachable.
The `ready-for-agent` / `agent-running` / `needs-human` / `workflow-failure` labels
need **no** bootstrap step: the scheduler ensures each exists (create-if-missing,
idempotent) before it dispatches, so they materialize on the first run and self-heal
if deleted — GitHub never creates a label on demand when it is applied, so the
assigner guaranteeing it is the correct home for that (the label-create-before-add
principle, in code). "A consuming project
schedules nothing" flips to "a consuming project schedules **itself**";
baselining's close-the-enrollment-issue step retires; open Enroll issues are
closed during migration.

## 10. Docs and checks rewritten alongside

`routines/fleet/scheduling.md` + `DESIGN.md` (new doctrine),
`gha/no-scheduled-fleet-executor` (rescope: the vendored scheduler workflow is
the repo's only permitted cron; a competing cron's work moves into a scheduler
task and the workflow is deleted),
`chrome-extension-release/release-workflows.mjs` (require **no** cron instead of
the contract cron), `in-session-github-access` (unchanged for session-side code
— executor + workers stay MCP-only; exempt `engine/scheduler/` Action-side
code, which legitimately uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`), the unattended-agents skill
(task-folder convention absorbs the routine-folder shape; new rule: issue-driven
dispatch security — label-as-authorization, first-line path validation in code,
issue content is data), `bootstrap.md` Part 6, `packs/README.md` /
`extending.md` (`run_daily` → `tasks`; `local_packs` → `local/packs`), the
`local_packs` reference set (engine `LOCAL_PACKS_SUBDIR` / `LOCAL_DECL_PREFIX`
constants, growth-stage docs' capture-surface definition, the
claudinite-isolation carve-outs), the sheepdog pack's RULES.md (census
classification note — landed with this PR), and GCEC's `CLAUDE.md` / gcec
`RULES.md` routine pointers.

## 11. Decisions on record (owner, 2026-07-22)

1. **Executor = per-repo CCR routine fired by the `ready-for-agent` label
   event** (revised in review: event-wired, not an hourly poll). Keeps the
   MCP-only session model, no repo secrets; per-task models via subagent
   dispatch.
2. **Task layout = `tasks/<name>/` directory** per task (rename of `run_daily/`),
   helpers beside `task.mjs`/`task.md`.
3. **Model field = family names** `opus | sonnet | haiku | none`, one vendored
   family→id map.
4. **GCEC routines move into the gcec local pack** (`dev/routines/` folders
   relocate; `routine.md` becomes `task.md`).
5. **`local_packs` → `local/packs`** (review): uniform pack depth, single scan
   root; canonical declaration token `local/<id>`, legacy forms accepted.
6. **The release workflow's independent cron is absorbed** into the
   store-release task (review): the scheduler is the repo's only cron.
7. **Baselining (with migration-note apply folded in) is a per-repo basics
   task**, not a fleet pass; migrations-retire stays canon-side with
   stamp+probe evidence (review).
8. **Census and prose-to-checks are not fleet tasks** (review): the census is an
   ordinary sheepdog pack task whose implementation happens to scan the fleet;
   prose-to-checks is a canon-local task, **daily**. *(Prose-to-checks since
   became a per-repo claudinite-growth task and moved to `weekly`.)*
9. **Growth chain ordered across the four daily slots** (review): baselining +
   migrations-apply `daily-2h` (02:00) → extract `daily-1h` (03:00) → promote
   `daily` (04:00) → dedup `daily+1h` (05:00). *(Dedup since moved to `weekly`,
   #582 — see the as-built note in §2; the rest of the chain is unchanged.)*
10. **Scheduler cron minute constrained to :10–:50** (review).

## 12. Decisions on record (owner, 2026-08-06) — the three-responsibility rework

These override the earlier sections where they conflict.

1. **Three responsibilities, strictly separated.** The scheduler CREATES task
   issues; the executor EXECUTES exactly the one issue that triggered it — no
   cleanups, no merging of tasks, no attention to other tasks, failed attempts
   or scheduling; the **task-janitor** — an ordinary daily `agent_model: none`
   task in the basics pack — owns dispatch-issue recovery (stale escalation,
   dead-claim reclaim, lost-event re-arm) and the health review. This retires
   §5's "scheduler's maintenance pass" (`maintainDispatchIssues` left `run.mjs`;
   the janitor's worker is the only I/O shell over `dispatch.mjs`'s unchanged
   pure rules). Stated trade: recovery latency for a lost label event or dead
   claim grows from ~an hour to up to a day.
2. **A dispatch whose task the repo no longer carries is CLOSED, not triaged.**
   `resolve-dispatch`'s `task-gone` verdict (task file or `task.mjs` missing,
   pack undeclared) → the executor comments and closes the issue as not
   planned. No `needs-human`, and no task ever keeps updating a tracking issue
   about a failed state — every exit is one terminal convergence. Malformed
   dispatches (bad path shape, unparseable declaration) keep the `needs-human`
   convergence: those may be forgery or breakage a human must see.
3. **The precondition is a task's only decision point.** After it passes, the
   two execution phases must not skip the run for state/timing reasons;
   failures may stop a run, discretion may not, and an empty outcome is always
   legal. Enforced as doctrine in the `writing-tasks` skill and hunted by the
   advisory `task-phase-discipline` world check (basics).
4. **The phases are named code-work and agentic work** — similar, consecutive
   parts of one task execution, neither framed as serving the other. Contract:
   `code_work` / `code_work_timeout` (legacy `agent_preprocessing` /
   `agent_preprocessing_timeout` accepted and normalized at load; the shape
   check flags them for rename). The task-code-work design record moved to
   `docs/task-code-work/`; the run-record outcome word is `code_work` (the parser
   still reads `preprocess` from pre-rename logs).
5. **Task statuses are distilled from the conversation logs, in hard-coded
   code.** Executor-side terminal states print a machine-readable
   `claudinite-task-exec v1 <pack>/<task> [<slot>] <status>` record
   (`success` / `failed` / `task-gone` / `invalid`; rendered by
   `record-exec.mjs` and `resolve-dispatch.mjs`, format owned by
   `run-record.mjs`). The captured executor transcripts carry them to the
   conversation-logs branch, and the fully automatic `usage-fold` task counts
   them (`taskExec` rows) beside the scheduler-side census — invocations,
   precondition passes, code-work runs, failures, deferrals (§ skill-usage-metrics
   DESIGN §4.2/§4.3).
6. **Invocation stays label-event-wired.** Migrating executor invocation to a
   URL-invoked routine was considered and declined: the label is both the
   trigger and the write-gated authorization surface, the re-arm recovery is
   built on it, and a URL endpoint would add a callable credential to every
   repo's Action for no reduction in moving parts. Revisit only if the platform
   grows a first-class routine-invocation API with equivalent auth.
7. **Delivery lands every cycle (owner, 2026-08-07; #690).** The 2026-08-07
   forced fleet deployment of this rework surfaced a race in the #649 in-cycle
   landing (an empty run list read 0.3s after dispatching the verification run
   was judged terminal), stranding seven members' green maintenance PRs. Fixed
   the same day: `landAttempt` waits for the runs the worker itself dispatched,
   and the arm predicate follows #677's insight — gate on what the base branch
   REQUIRES, with `land` (verify-then-merge, no doomed arm) on unprotected
   bases. The deployment itself modeled the shelf-life rule (#684): forced
   fleet passes, watched to terminal state, stragglers landed in-session —
   never "check tomorrow".
8. **One delivery procedure, shared by every PR-delivering task (owner,
   2026-08-07).** The #690 landing nuances were baselining's alone while the
   other `merged-pr` tasks hit the identical failure shapes — growth-extract's
   worker prose claimed "where the repo has no CI, GitHub lands it as soon as
   it's mergeable" (false: the arm is rejected `clean status` and the PR
   strands), and `deliver-generated.mjs` (usage-fold, fleet-usage) swallowed
   the arm rejection and never dispatched the PR's checks at all. The landing
   moved to one home per lane: `engine/scheduler/land-pr.mjs` (code lane —
   baselining's worker and deliver-generated both call `landDelivery`) and its
   prose twin `engine/scheduler/deliver-pr.md` (agent lane — vendored, linked
   from every merged-pr task.md), which must keep saying the same thing. The
   contract: a task knows only its outcome CEILING; whether its PR actually
   lands unreviewed is the repo's `maintenance.delivery` plus the repo's own
   shape (no PR CI / ungated base / gate present), and every one of those
   nuances lives in the helpers, never in a task.

## 13. Decision on record (owner, 2026-08-14) — the exit code says whether the routine broke

`resolve-dispatch.mjs` gave each verdict its own exit code (0/10/11/12/13/14)
and the executor branched on the number. Every verdict but `valid` therefore
ended a session non-zero, which harnesses paint as a failed command: an
ordinary "not mine, another session claimed it" read as red in the transcript,
and taught both the human skimming it and the agent acting on it that a routine
outcome was a fault.

**The rule, replacing the old table: exit 0 whenever the routine goes on —
including when going on means stopping on purpose — and non-zero only when it
stops unexpectedly.**

- The **verdict** is the interface, and always was available: every decided
  branch prints `dispatch: <verdict>` as the first line of its block, so the
  executor branches on that field and loses nothing. `valid`, `needs-issue`,
  `invalid`, `task-gone` and `not-mine` all exit **0** — the first two because
  the routine continues, the next two because the routine has prescribed work to
  do (comment, de-label, close), the last because an expected stop is not an
  error.
- The **exit code** answers only "did this routine break". Non-zero survives for
  `no-trigger` (`12`, unchanged — no source named an issue, a defect worth a
  human seeing), `scope-mismatch` (`15`, new) and the two faults, `usage` (`2`)
  and `internal` (`1`).
- **`scope-mismatch` is split out of the old `not-mine`** and is the one stop
  loud enough to keep its red. Each executor routine fires on its own ready
  label, so a dispatch arriving under the other scope's label did not wander in:
  the routine that woke for it is misconfigured (a fleet routine whose prompt
  lost the word `fleet`, most often). Nothing on GitHub records that, the
  janitor re-arms the dispatch, and it declines forever until a human reads the
  session — so the session is the only place the signal can live.
- Codes `10`, `11`, `13` and `14` are **retired, not renumbered**, so no live
  code carries a changed meaning for a reader who remembers the old table.

Enforced by `engine-tests/scheduler/resolve-dispatch.test.mjs`, which asserts the
rule over every verdict in one test as well as per-verdict, with the codes
written literal so a renumbering cannot pass green.
