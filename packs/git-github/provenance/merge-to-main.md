## 2026-09-01 · born · converted from references.md (merge-to-main-1)
- **Reason:** The capture step runs **here, in-session, because it needs the live transcript** —
  nothing later can reach it, which is why this is a step of the merge rather than something
  scheduled. Extraction is deliberately not done here: the lessons pass happens later in the
  `claudinite-growth` pack's `growth-extract` task, over the captured logs, so this step stays
  deterministic and seconds-long. Recovered from the skill's own pre-#1092 text, cut when
  `verify-in-production` was split out of this skill (`8da4c916`).
- **Mechanism:** a step of the merge-to-main skill, a workflow
- **Retire when:** Reaffirm while `capture-log.mjs` reads the session transcript and
  `growth-extract` owns the conversation half; retire if capture stops needing a live session.

## 2026-09-20 · reworded · the sync-main step became a conditional note
- **Reason:** the merge is normally a session's last act: an unattended run has no further work
  and an interactive one rarely does, so syncing `main` unconditionally spent a step on a
  checkout nobody read next. Loading the skill puts the sync in context for the session that does go
  on to more work, which is all that case needs.

## 2026-09-20 · trigger-changed · the LGTM prompt trigger was never the skill's to declare
- **Reason:** "LGTM" is one person's own approval word, recorded in their preferences store, which
  already names this skill as what the phrase reaches for. A canon skill declaring the same regex
  forced itself on every member of the fleet for a phrase nobody there chose, and gave the word two
  owners. The description no longer quotes it either.
- **Mechanism:** the skill keeps its shape-based trigger, `force-load-on-tool-calls` on
  `mcp__github__merge_pull_request`, true for anyone merging however they asked for it, plus the
  description the model matches. The phrase stays the preference's.
