// Technology pack: a native macOS app — the app bundle, TCC and Hardened
// Runtime, the Developer ID / notarization / DMG distribution lane, and the
// process-lifecycle rules a Mac agent app has to get right.
//
// Fingerprint: a `Package.swift` at the repo root or one directory down (a
// monorepo's `mac/` dir), never deeper, so a nested fixture package can't trip
// detection. The marker only SUSPECTS the pack — a Swift package can be a
// library or an iOS-only target, and declaration stays the project's call. An
// iOS app declares `ios`; a Flutter app's macOS runner declares `flutter`.
