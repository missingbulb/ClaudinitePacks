## 2026-07-08 · born · Add executable-requirements pack; fill the flutter pack stub (#165)
- **Reason:** registered as a stub carrying a scope statement and nothing else, so the surface has a
  declared home and a routing target before any practice is captured; the canon is distilled from
  worked examples rather than written from imagination, so the rules wait for a project to exercise
  it for real. Registered in one batch with ios, play-store-release and app-store-release, on the
  lifecycle the flutter pack had just completed. The material expected to fill it is
  ShoutsAndWhispers' Android flavor split at its Firebase release milestone.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Fable 5, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** the pack manifest, fingerprinted by `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
- **Landed:** #165 (Refs #180) · pack version 1.

## 2026-09-03 · reworded · Every pack's RULES.md carries rules, not a description of the pack (#1634)
- **Reason:** the file opened with a paragraph saying what the pack covers. It changes nothing a
  session does, every session in every declaring repo paid for it, and the README and the manifest's
  `ruleRoutingGuidance` already carried it. Across the corpus the sweep took non-rule prose from
  2,900 words to 1,080.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #1634 (Refs #1632) · pack version 60902.1.

## 2026-09-05 · moved · Rules → skills: the audit's path-forced extractions; description-triggered ones stay prose (#1667)
- **Reason:** with the framing gone the prose file held only the stub note, and an absent prose file
  contributes nothing where that note cost every session four lines. The note is what an adopter
  needs rather than what a session needs, so it went to the README and the prose file was deleted
  rather than kept.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Fable 5.1, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** the pack README; the pack declares no prose file at all.
- **Landed:** #1667 (Refs #1662) · pack version 60903.1.

## 2026-09-21 · reaffirmed · the entries above cite Refs where each pull request closed its issue
- **Source:** the pull request bodies, read directly rather than through the commit trailer: #165
  opens `Closes #180`, #1634 `Closes #1632`, #1667 `Closes #1662`.
- **Reason:** the backfill took each linkage from the commit trailer, which says `Refs` in all
  three, and the brief derives it the same way. `Closes` is what filled GitHub's development panel
  and resolved the issue, so the entries above send a reader tracing this pack's closed work to a
  cross-reference instead. Nothing else in them changes.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5
- **Landed:** #2213.

## 2026-09-25 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` rises to 60925.1
- **Reason:** this pack's checks declare `on_fail`, which an older engine does not read; the pack
  update holds this version until the member's engine is at 60925.1.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces.

## 2026-09-27 · born · a pitch paragraph for the dashboard's plain-repo view
- **Reason:** the dashboard shows a repo that does not run Claudinite the packs that fit it, and the
  owner asked for one paragraph per pack naming its main skills and process gains, with rough counts
  so it outlives the pack's growth.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `pitch` field, beside `ruleRoutingGuidance`.

## 2026-09-27 · scope-changed · the fingerprint is a `relevanceDetector` spec, not a function
- **Reason:** the owner asked for fingerprints a reader holding only GitHub's API can judge cheaply
  - a tree listing, a code search, then only the files that search names - which a function over a
  synchronous `read` cannot offer.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `relevanceDetector` (engine/pack_loader/relevance-detector.mjs): `paths`, optional `text`,
  `search` terms; it answers exactly what the retired `detect` answered, proven over 4,000 composed
  repos before the change.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the fingerprint's patterns are written as source strings
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data cannot hold a RegExp; each pattern is its source string, or {
  source, flags } where it carries a flag, and loads to the same RegExp.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the manifest becomes pack.json
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data is read with no import and by any tool; the conversion wrote
  the module's evaluated export, and the pack loads identically.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** pack.json, which the loader prefers over pack.mjs; a canon pack now needs engine
  60928.1, the first to read it.

## 2026-10-03 · scope-changed · the first version on the cn floor
- **Reason:** `60928.1` named a Node engine version, which `cn` read only as the legacy two-part
  form; with that tolerance retired (ClaudiniteEngine#18) a two-part entry is one `cn` skips, so
  the pack's newest version names `61001.1.0`, the floor every ported pack names. Nothing in the
  pack runs, so no higher floor is a claim anything tests.
- **Actor:** build lead, ClaudinitePacks#30 T1.
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces. android 61003.1.

## 2026-10-04 · scope-changed · the version takes the <major>.<day>.<n> form
- **Reason:** pack versions follow the Engine's `<major>.<day>.<n>` scheme; an index sorts every
  earlier version below one in that form, so this one outranks what the pack store already holds.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking that pack versions follow the same scheme.
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5.5
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `version`, which the release now requires in this form for a new
  version. android 1.61004.1.

## 2026-10-05 · scope-changed · routing no longer names the store-release packs
- **Reason:** `app-store-release` and `play-store-release` were stubs no repository declared, and
  the owner deleted them with `hello`; an `excludes` naming them routed to nothing.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking that hello, app-store-release and play-store-release be deleted.
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5.5
- **Mechanism:** `ruleRoutingGuidance.excludes` in the manifest. android 1.61005.1.
