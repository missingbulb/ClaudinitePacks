# flutter pack

Active when the repo has `pubspec.yaml` at its root or one directory down. Durable,
project-agnostic Flutter practices in `RULES.md`: ports-and-adapters out of the widget tree (with
the committed import-boundary test and the shipped fake world), widget-test/golden mechanics (real
fonts, no `pumpAndSettle` on spinners, injectable fetchers, fixed viewport, the async-epoch guard),
and toolchain habits (pub-cache API verification, zero-issue analyze, stall-robust test runners for
sandboxes). Prose, two checks and two skills - the import scan and the coverage gates the pack asks
for live as committed tests inside the consuming project.

## Rules (`RULES.md`)

| Rule | Severity | Reason | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Widgets depend on ports, never on plugins. | medium | complexity | prose: <100 words |
| Enforce the boundary with an import scan | medium | complexity | prose: <50 words |
| Ship the fakes in the package | low | complexity | prose: <100 words |
| Extract the root shell into a widget | low | complexity | prose: <50 words |
| Anything that fetches must be injectable | medium | complexity | prose: <50 words + check (`flutter/network-fetch-in-widget-tree`) |
| Async lifecycle guards need an epoch counter. | high | correctness | prose: <100 words |
| Real I/O in testWidgets needs runAsync | high | correctness | prose: <100 words |
| Verify plugin APIs against installed source | high | correctness | prose: <50 words |
| flutter analyze at zero issues | medium | complexity | prose: <50 words |
| Sandboxed/CI runners | medium | complexity | prose: <100 words |

## Checks

| Check | Severity | Reason | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `flutter/network-fetch-in-widget-tree` | medium | complexity | check: blocking |
| `flutter/device-clock-not-injected` | high | correctness | check: blocking |

`flutter/device-clock-not-injected` scans `lib/**.dart` outside `lib/testing/` for an
argument-less `DateTime.now()`; a file declaring a `class …Clock` is exempt.
`flutter/network-fetch-in-widget-tree` scans `lib/ui|screens|widgets/**.dart` for a tree
constructing its own network image or tile provider.

The golden mechanics are the [`flutter-golden-tests`](skills/flutter-golden-tests/SKILL.md) skill
and lockfile skew is [`flutter-pubspec`](skills/flutter-pubspec/SKILL.md); each forces itself for
the files it concerns.

## Skills

| Skill | Trigger |
|---|---|
| [`flutter-golden-tests`](skills/flutter-golden-tests/SKILL.md) | any edit of a `*_test.dart` or a Dart file under `test/` — held by the guard until loaded |
| [`flutter-pubspec`](skills/flutter-pubspec/SKILL.md) | any edit of `pubspec.yaml` or `pubspec.lock` — held by the guard until loaded |

## Environment

The Claude Code web sandbox boots without a Flutter SDK, so `flutter test`, `flutter analyze` and
golden regeneration can't run until it is installed. The install belongs in the environment
**image**, built once and snapshotted: this pack declares that need in its `env` block
([pack.mjs](pack.mjs)), and a project pastes one
generic `environment-setup-command.sh` that runs every active pack's requirement via
[engine/pack_loader/env-requirements.mjs](../../engine/pack_loader/env-requirements.mjs) and asserts
it at session start (see [bootstrap.md](../../bootstrap.md) Part 9).
