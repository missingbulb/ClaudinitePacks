## 2026-09-05 · born · Rules to skills: the audit's path-forced extractions (#1667)
- **Reason:** a rule leaves RULES.md for a skill only where that skill's
  `force-load-on-file-edits-paths` covers every moment the rule is needed; a skill the model would
  have to pick by description alone is not predictable. These rules are all predicted by an edit of
  the template or the package manifest, so they move, while the deploy-time failures, which no file
  edit predicts, stay in the prose.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Fable 5.1, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** a skill whose body is guidelines, forced for `**/template.yaml` and
  `**/template.yml` - the moment a SAM template is edited is exactly when its CloudFront, CORS,
  cache and DynamoDB index shapes are decided.
- **Landed:** #1667 (Closes #1662) · pack version 60903.1.

## 2026-09-25 · trigger-changed · description cut to the 30-word cap
- **Reason:** the description summarised the method the body already carries; every session paid for
  it.
- **Mechanism:** the description, as before.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
