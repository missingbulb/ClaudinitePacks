// The two fixed paths the whole standard hangs off: the index README and the

// sink-first scaffold is legitimate) and neither is sample-data/ (an exclusion
// in the classifier, not an obligation). A path satisfies the check when it is
// tracked OR freshly written and not yet staged (ctx.files carries untracked
// files) — a mid-session scaffold must not wedge the Stop hook into
// re-creating files that already exist.
