## 2026-07-17 · born · Add product-wiki pack: the self-growing product research wiki standard (#301)
- **Source:** the standard missingbulb/GoogleCalendarEventCreator had just adopted (its #678) - the
  LLM-wiki pattern Karpathy described: compile findings once, refine in place, cite everything, keep
  a dated growth log.
- **Reason:** the standard is structural rather than configured. Two reserved names under the wiki
  root have fixed meaning and everything else under it is wiki space, so there is no wikis manifest
  to drift and a renamed or added wiki folder stays classified, checked and barred. The pack takes
  no config: the layout is the config.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 5, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** the pack manifest, fingerprinted on the sink's README - the standard's one
  structural constant.
- **Rejected:** a runner-level manifest seam for "this pack accepts no config", left until a second
  pack needs it, so the guard rode the layout rule's id instead.
- **Landed:** #301 (Refs #302) · pack version 1.

## 2026-09-04 · reworded · Absorb barriers into basics, and stop it interviewing on adoption (#1684)
- **Reason:** the declared requirement on the barriers pack was vestigial once the isolation wall
  became a declared check the engine runs; a declared check needs nothing else declared beside it
  for the wall to stand.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #1684 (Closes #1681) · pack version 60904.1.

## 2026-09-25 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` rises to 60925.1
- **Reason:** this pack's checks declare `on_fail`, which an older engine does not read; the pack
  update holds this version until the member's engine is at 60925.1.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces.

## 2026-09-27 · born · a pitch paragraph for the dashboard's plain-repo view
- **Reason:** the dashboard shows a repo that does not run Claudinite the packs that fit it, and the
  owner asked for one paragraph per pack naming its main skills and process gains, with rough counts
  so it outlives the pack's growth.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `pitch` field, beside `ruleRoutingGuidance`.

## 2026-09-27 · scope-changed · the fingerprint is a `relevanceDetector` spec, not a function
- **Reason:** the owner asked for fingerprints a reader holding only GitHub's API can judge cheaply
  - a tree listing, a code search, then only the files that search names - which a function over a
  synchronous `read` cannot offer.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `relevanceDetector` (engine/pack_loader/relevance-detector.mjs): `paths`, optional `text`,
  `search` terms; it answers exactly what the retired `detect` answered, proven over 4,000 composed
  repos before the change.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the manifest spells out the value it imported
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data cannot import; the value is written out, and the pack's test
  holds it equal to the module it came from.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests with imported values inlined and a
  check against drift.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the fingerprint's patterns are written as source strings
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data cannot hold a RegExp; each pattern is its source string, or {
  source, flags } where it carries a flag, and loads to the same RegExp.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the manifest's comments leave it, their decisions recorded here
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data carries no comments. What they decided: the isolation wall and
  the skeleton check are a designed pair: the wall's glob fails closed on an empty product-wiki/,
  and the layout check owns the missing-skeleton complaint. The interview's answers frame which
  wikis are seeded and are recorded as intent, never as config; a session reads the repo's own brief
  first and confirms rather than asking cold.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests, their comments deleted or moved
  to a README or provenance.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the manifest becomes pack.json
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data is read with no import and by any tool; the conversion wrote
  the module's evaluated export, and the pack loads identically.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** pack.json, which the loader prefers over pack.mjs; a canon pack now needs engine
  60928.1, the first to read it.

## 2026-09-28 · scope-changed · the fingerprint is dropped; the pack is declared by hand
- **Reason:** the sink README is the pack's own artifact, so it is only there once the pack is
  adopted: not an indicator for adoption.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), in review of #2382.
- **Mechanism:** no relevanceDetector, so --init and the fleet sweep never suggest it.

## 2026-10-02 · ported · wiki-growth drops its `$schema` key
- **Reason:** the `$schema` key pointed at `claudinite-tasks/task.schema.json`, which left with the Node runner; the engine validates a declaration itself (`cn tasks contract`) and publishes no schema file, so the key is dropped as the hello pack's tasks do.
- **Actor:** build lead, completing ClaudinitePacks #20 so the runner's removal lands with every importer ported.
- **Mechanism:** the declaration loses the key; the pack test reads the declaration as written. product-wiki 61002.1.

## 2026-10-02 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` moves to `61001.1.0`
- **Reason:** `60928.1` is a Node engine version, which `cn` reads only as the legacy two-part form any engine satisfies (ClaudiniteEngine#18); a new version must name the `cn` release it needs, and release-packs refused product-wiki 61002.1 for carrying it. `61001.1.0` is the engine floor, below which no `cn` is released, so it holds back no engine the old value admitted.
- **Actor:** build lead, repairing release-packs on main after ClaudinitePacks #20.
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces; `release.mjs plan` now refuses a two-part value on a version to publish before the merge. product-wiki 61002.1.
