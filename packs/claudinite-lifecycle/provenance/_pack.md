## 2026-08-14 · born · Claudinite's own surface becomes a pack of its own (#836)
- **Source:** the mount, the declaration, bootstrapping, pack adoption and the scheduled-task
  contract were split across the two packs that happen to be seeded everywhere.
- **Reason:** neither host claimed that territory in its routing guidance, so a session extracting a
  lesson about Claudinite itself read both as an honest "no pack owns this".
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** a mandatory pack: `basics` requires it, so the closure vendors its content and
  materializes its declaration wherever a declaration is written, and a seed record declares it into
  members that already exist. Both run outside any check, because activation reads the literal
  declaration.
- **Rejected:** letting the declared check be what makes the pack mandatory. It does not run in a
  member that has no entry, so it reports a lost declaration rather than being what puts it there.
- **Landed:** #836 (Closes #835, phase 1).

## 2026-08-19 · moved · renamed core to claudinite-lifecycle, and the authoring contract leaves (#1029)
- **Reason:** the pack owns a member's Claudinite status, and `core` said none of that. The
  scheduled-task authoring contract goes to the growth pack with it: those rules ask whether a task
  is written correctly, which is authoring, while every check left behind asks whether Claudinite is
  working in this repo.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the engine's rename map, applied at the four seams where a pack id is read, plus an
  engine migration record that moves the stale mount directory and rewrites the declaration.
  Activation matches a declared id literally, so a member declaring the old name while its mount
  ships the new one gets no pack at all, and this pack carries the task that would deliver the
  repair.
- **Landed:** #1029 (Closes #1022) · pack version 8.

## 2026-08-21 · moved · the inline version history leaves pack.mjs for VERSIONS.md (#1181)
- **Reason:** every pack gets one version-history file, checked by `pack-version-bumped`, so the
  manifest's header stops carrying a log that grows without bound.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** `VERSIONS.md` beside the manifest, one row per version.
- **Landed:** #1181 · pack version 60821.3.

## 2026-08-23 · moved · the manifest stops restating its own tree (#1248)
- **Reason:** `id`, `prose`, `badge`, `skills`, `worldRules` and `workRules` were each spelled in
  the manifest and also visible in the directory, so the two could disagree.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** the pack directory is the declaration; coded rules live under
  `worldRules`/`workRules` and tests under `test/`, which no vendor set ships. `minEngineVersion`
  rises to the engine release that reads all of it.
- **Landed:** #1248 (Refs #1225, #1231) · pack version 60822.3.

## 2026-09-04 · reworded · the barriers requirement goes (#1684)
- **Reason:** it was vestigial once the isolation wall became a declared check, and the pack it
  named was being absorbed into `basics`.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Landed:** #1684 · pack version 60904.1.

## 2026-09-25 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` rises to 60925.1
- **Reason:** this pack's checks declare `on_fail`, which an older engine does not read; the pack
  update holds this version until the member's engine is at 60925.1.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces.

## 2026-09-27 · born · a pitch paragraph for the dashboard's plain-repo view
- **Reason:** the dashboard shows a repo that does not run Claudinite the packs that fit it, and the
  owner asked for one paragraph per pack naming its main skills and process gains, with rough counts
  so it outlives the pack's growth.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `pitch` field, beside `ruleRoutingGuidance`.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the manifest's comments leave it, their decisions recorded here
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data carries no comments. What they decided: the pack is mandatory:
  basics requires it, which vendors its content and materializes its declaration, and the
  2026-08-14-core-seed record declared it into members that already existed. The update task lives
  here, which is why claudinite-lifecycle-declared blocks: a repo that loses this pack's entry loses
  its self-refresh, and nothing is left that could deliver one.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests, their comments deleted or moved
  to a README or provenance.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the manifest becomes pack.json
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data is read with no import and by any tool; the conversion wrote
  the module's evaluated export, and the pack loads identically.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** pack.json, which the loader prefers over pack.mjs; a canon pack now needs engine
  60928.1, the first to read it.

## 2026-10-02 · ported · adopt-requested-packs drops its `$schema` key
- **Reason:** the `$schema` key pointed at `claudinite-tasks/task.schema.json`, which left with the Node runner; the engine validates a declaration itself (`cn tasks contract`) and publishes no schema file, so the key is dropped as the hello pack's tasks do.
- **Actor:** build lead, completing ClaudinitePacks #20 so the runner's removal lands with every importer ported.
- **Mechanism:** the declaration loses the key and the pack's task tests read the contract, the precondition and the merge policy through `cn tasks`; `updates/`, `tasks/update/` and `test/update-worker.test.mjs` are Engine chunk 11's and untouched. lifecycle 61002.3.

## 2026-10-02 · reworded · the pack says it is the engine's own: `"engine": true`
- **Reason:** which packs' tasks run as the engine's own, under the license, was a literal list
  in the engine; reading it off the manifest makes it a property of the pack (ClaudiniteEngine
  design record row 75). Absent means not engine; there is no default.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), through ClaudiniteEngine chunk 11 (#45).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5.5, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** a boolean in pack.json, which an engine from chunk 11 on reads.

## 2026-10-04 · scope-changed · the version takes the <major>.<day>.<n> form
- **Reason:** pack versions follow the Engine's `<major>.<day>.<n>` scheme; an index sorts every
  earlier version below one in that form, so this one outranks what the pack store already holds.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking that pack versions follow the same scheme.
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5.5
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `version`, which the release now requires in this form for a new
  version. claudinite-lifecycle 1.61004.1.
