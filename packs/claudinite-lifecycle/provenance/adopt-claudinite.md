- **Reason:** a repo adopting usually arrives with a CLAUDE.md, and nothing asked about it, so its

- **Model:** claude-opus-5
- **Landed:** #2191

## 2026-09-25 · trigger-changed · "baseline a repo" retired from the description

- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the skill description, re-vendoring kept as a trigger.

## 2026-09-25 · trigger-changed · description cut to the 30-word cap
- **Reason:** the description summarised the method the body already carries; every session paid for
  it.
- **Mechanism:** the description, as before.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
