// WHY. The deploy workflow is VENDORED into each Pages repo's own .github/ — GitHub
// runs a Pages deploy only from a workflow job in the repo's own tree, never from
// the mount — so the pack holds the template and each repo hosts a managed copy:
// edit the pack, not the copy. And it is the ONE publisher: the `site-release` task
// dispatches it at the commit it released, which is what makes the version the
// repo records the version the site serves. A second workflow that deploys, or a
// push trigger on this one, ships a tree with no version cut and no park lane, and
// its green run looks exactly like success.
//
// SCOPE. The repo's own workflows. A commented-out step is not a publisher.

// The publishing steps a Pages repo reaches for.
