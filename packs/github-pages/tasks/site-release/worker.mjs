// site-release — cut a version, deploy the default branch to GitHub Pages, record it.
//
// The whole run is deterministic: read the branch tip, advance the version, push that
// bump, dispatch the deploy at that exact commit and wait for it. Nothing here is a
// judgment call, which is why the task runs no agent. The deploy itself is the one
// part that is not code-work: a Pages deploy is made of marketplace actions that only
// a workflow job can run, so the task owns the trigger and the decision and the
// vendored workflow carries those steps.
//
// ORDER IS DELIBERATE: the bump lands on the branch BEFORE the deploy. Either half
// can fail, and of the two possible drifts only one is silent — a site serving a
// version the repo has no record of. A consumed version number that never shipped is
// visible in the park and costs nothing; the next release simply takes the next one.
//
// THE VERSION IS ANOTHER PACK'S. public-website owns the scheme and the page stamp,
// and publishes them through its `public/version.mjs`; this worker imports that seam
// when the pack is on the mount and releases without a bump when it is not. Nothing
// else of that pack is reached, and nothing here knows how the version is shaped.
