## 2026-09-18 · born · Split the website packs by ownership: public-website, github-pages, cloudflare-site (#2101)
- **Source:** the owner's boundary, 2026-09-17: a hosting pack "needs to only care itself with how
  to serve, wire release, maintain a release ... not anything else that deals 'being a website' like
  versions".
- **Reason:** `static-website` conflated what is true of a static site with what is true of one
  served from GitHub Pages, so a repo hosting its site anywhere else could take only half the pack,
  and the half it left behind was where three of the four checks lived. The serving half becomes its
  own pack, rebuilt in the shape `cloudflare-site`'s release already had: a Pages deploy is made of
  marketplace actions only a workflow job can run, so that is all the one vendored workflow carries,
  dispatch-only, and everything else about a release is the `site-release` task. Four workflows and
  three composite actions become one workflow and two scripts; the GitHub Release, the tag and the
  bump dispatch go with the versions they carried, which are `public-website`'s now. The pack names
  no other host: a site is served from Pages or from something else, never both.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5, Claude Fable 5.1, per the commit trailers.
- **Mechanism:** the pack manifest, fingerprinted by `.github/site.config`, the pack's own central
  artifact, and requiring `claudinite-tasks` because the release is a work item rather than a
  workflow.
- **Landed:** #2101 · pack version 60917.1.

## 2026-09-25 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` rises to 60925.1
- **Reason:** this pack's checks declare `on_fail`, which an older engine does not read; the pack
  update holds this version until the member's engine is at 60925.1.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces.

## 2026-09-27 · born · a pitch paragraph for the dashboard's plain-repo view
- **Reason:** the dashboard shows a repo that does not run Claudinite the packs that fit it, and the
  owner asked for one paragraph per pack naming its main skills and process gains, with rough counts
  so it outlives the pack's growth.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `pitch` field, beside `ruleRoutingGuidance`.

## 2026-09-27 · scope-changed · the fingerprint is a `relevanceDetector` spec, not a function
- **Reason:** the owner asked for fingerprints a reader holding only GitHub's API can judge cheaply
  - a tree listing, a code search, then only the files that search names - which a function over a
  synchronous `read` cannot offer.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `relevanceDetector` (engine/pack_loader/relevance-detector.mjs): `paths`, optional `text`,
  `search` terms; it answers exactly what the retired `detect` answered, proven over 4,000 composed
  repos before the change.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the manifest spells out the value it imported
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data cannot import; the value is written out, and the pack's test
  holds it equal to the module it came from.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests with imported values inlined and a
  check against drift.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the fingerprint's patterns are written as source strings
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data cannot hold a RegExp; each pattern is its source string, or {
  source, flags } where it carries a flag, and loads to the same RegExp.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the manifest's comments leave it, their decisions recorded here
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data carries no comments. What they decided: the release is a task
  so the queue owns its trigger, gate and park lanes. The one question's answer, what is published,
  lives in the repo's own .github/site.config rather than on the pack entry, where the deploy's
  build step and the gp/site-config check both read it. The handover steps are repository settings
  no workflow, check or agent can turn on.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests, their comments deleted or moved
  to a README or provenance.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the manifest becomes pack.json
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data is read with no import and by any tool; the conversion wrote
  the module's evaluated export, and the pack loads identically.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** pack.json, which the loader prefers over pack.mjs; a canon pack now needs engine
  60928.1, the first to read it.

## 2026-10-02 · ported · site-release runs on `@claudinite/sdk`
- **Reason:** the `$schema` key pointed at `claudinite-tasks/task.schema.json`, which left with the Node runner; the engine validates a declaration itself (`cn tasks contract`) and publishes no schema file, so the key is dropped as the hello pack's tasks do. The worker took the runner's `gh`/`token` parameters.
- **Actor:** build lead, completing ClaudinitePacks #20 so the runner's removal lands with every importer ported.
- **Mechanism:** the worker reads the SDK's params and git, its workflow dispatch with inputs, run reads and Pages reads a pack-local REST copy on the job's token; the declaration drops `$schema`. github-pages 61002.1.
