## 2026-07-19 · born · web-speech pack: browser voice I/O - 2 skill-owned checks + runtime-gotcha prose (#346)
- **Source:** missingbulb/CrosswordChat, a Chrome extension that solves the NYT crossword
  conversationally: its `extension/src/speech/` ports, the service-worker TTS relay, and its
  `dev/docs/FEASIBILITY.md` speech-API analysis.
- **Reason:** browser voice I/O is a facet of its own - the runtime behaviour of the recognition and
  synthesis APIs - and one project had accumulated enough of it to be portable.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** the pack manifest, fingerprinted by a browser speech-API reference in JS/TS source.
  The marker only suspects the pack; declaring it stays the project's call, as for every pack.
- **Rejected:** making the pack checks-only. Of the seventeen gotchas only two had a file-scoped
  signature; the rest are runtime and behavioural, with no repo state a static check could read, so
  the pack is mostly prose by design rather than by omission.
- **Landed:** #346 (Refs #303) · pack version 1.

## 2026-09-25 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` rises to 60925.1
- **Reason:** this pack's checks declare `on_fail`, which an older engine does not read; the pack
  update holds this version until the member's engine is at 60925.1.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces.

## 2026-09-27 · born · a pitch paragraph for the dashboard's plain-repo view
- **Reason:** the dashboard shows a repo that does not run Claudinite the packs that fit it, and the
  owner asked for one paragraph per pack naming its main skills and process gains, with rough counts
  so it outlives the pack's growth.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `pitch` field, beside `ruleRoutingGuidance`.

## 2026-09-27 · scope-changed · the fingerprint is a `relevanceDetector` spec, not a function
- **Reason:** the owner asked for fingerprints a reader holding only GitHub's API can judge cheaply
  - a tree listing, a code search, then only the files that search names - which a function over a
  synchronous `read` cannot offer.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `relevanceDetector` (engine/pack_loader/relevance-detector.mjs): `paths`, optional `text`,
  `search` terms; it answers exactly what the retired `detect` answered, proven over 4,000 composed
  repos before the change.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the fingerprint's patterns are written as source strings
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data cannot hold a RegExp; each pattern is its source string, or {
  source, flags } where it carries a flag, and loads to the same RegExp.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the manifest becomes pack.json
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data is read with no import and by any tool; the conversion wrote
  the module's evaluated export, and the pack loads identically.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** pack.json, which the loader prefers over pack.mjs; a canon pack now needs engine
  60928.1, the first to read it.
