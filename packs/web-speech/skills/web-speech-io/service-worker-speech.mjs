// The Web Speech recognition API and speechSynthesis are Window-scoped: they
// live on `window`/a document, which an MV3 background service worker does not
// have. Referencing them in the worker throws (recognition) or leaves the global
// undefined (synthesis) at runtime — a listen or speak that silently never
// happens. chrome.tts is the extension-only TTS engine that DOES run in the
// worker, so synthesis has a real worker path; recognition has none and must
// move to a document context. Repo-state on purpose: a worker that references
// one of these is a live break however long ago it merged.
//
// RELEVANCE FIRST (see engine/checks/README.md "Adding a rule"): a skill check runs on
// EVERY repo, so the gate is narrow — only the file an MV3 manifest.json names
// as `background.service_worker`, resolved relative to the manifest, and only
// when that file is the project's OWN authored source (ctx.files, so a built /
// bundled worker artifact that merely concatenates document-context source is
// out of scope — the same signature-less residue google-id-token-validation
// documents for code-form verifiers). No MV3 manifest, or a manifest that
// bundles its worker, means the check stays silent. The skill's own directory is
// excluded so its fixtures never self-flag on the corpus repo.
