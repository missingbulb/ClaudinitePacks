// raw REST with a token, and it is deliberately confined to the census — the
// account-spanning coverage audit that must enumerate EVERY repo the owner owns
// (`/user/repos`), which a session-scoped connection structurally cannot see. The
// census runs Action-side as the fleet-census task's preprocessing, with a
// fine-grained PAT; nothing in the daily-maintenance process imports this (that
// process is MCP-native and carries no REST client). It knows nothing about any
// specific pack: it is the generic "talk to many repos" layer, no more.
//
// It is READ-ONLY toward members but for ONE primitive — `putFile`, which the
// pack-seed sweep uses to land a declaration this fleet wants in every member.
// Keeping the write to a single named function is deliberate: "what can this module
// change in someone else's repo" then has exactly one answer to read.
