// The fleet-freshness preprocessing entry point — the script the scheduler runs as
// `node worker.mjs` (cwd = this task dir, bounded by agent_preprocessing_timeout).
//
// It holds NO sweep logic. The sweep is `check-fleet-freshness.mjs`, its SIBLING in
// this task folder — nothing outside this task uses it, so that is where it lives;
// this worker only invokes it. It is why the sweep stayed a plain module with an
// exported `main()` and a CLI guard: still runnable by hand, now also callable from
// here. Same shape as the census's worker, deliberately.
//
// Failure is the escalation path. The sweep THROWS when a member could not be
// probed ("unknown is not behind") or when its config/token is unusable; this
// worker turns that into a non-zero exit, and the scheduler treats a non-zero
// preprocessing subprocess as a failed task — it converges one open `needs-human`
// issue for the task family (engine/scheduler/run.mjs) instead of handing off to
// any agent.
