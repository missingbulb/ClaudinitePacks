  pitch: 'Image-processing code built on NumPy and SciPy fails in ways that still produce a plausible picture. This pack gives Claude Code sessions about ten rules for exactly those traps: statistics skewed by padding, thresholds that miss saturated pixels, off-by-one windows around a float center, affine transforms that pull rather than push, labels smeared by upscaling, and annotations drawn in a color that hides the signal. The result is fewer wrong measurements that look right and less time spent chasing them.',
