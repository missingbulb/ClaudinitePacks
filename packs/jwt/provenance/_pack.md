## 2026-08-08 · born · Add the jwt pack, distilled from The JWT Handbook (#705)
- **Source:** The JWT Handbook (Sebastián E. Peyrott, Auth0, v0.14.2): chapters 2-6 for
  applications and JWS/JWE/JWK structure, Annex A for the pitfalls, attacks and best current
  practices.
- **Reason:** token budget was the design constraint, so the pack injects no session-start prose at
  all and the book's teaching lands in deterministic-first layers instead: five checks whose failure
  message is the rule, and two action skills read only at usage time for what a static sweep cannot
  judge. Scoped to generic JWT practice, leaving the Google-issuer validator's own config and
  browser-client OAuth token acquisition to the packs that own them.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** the pack manifest, fingerprinted by a JWT library reference (`jsonwebtoken`,
  `jose`, PyJWT and their kin) in JS/TS/Python source. The marker only suspects the pack; declaring
  it stays the project's call.
- **Rejected:** a migration record to carry members across the three new blocking checks. The pack
  is opt-in, a fingerprint only suspects and baselining never auto-declares, so no existing member
  could turn red; a rehearsal fixture proving a member that does opt in converges green was the
  additive answer, negative-probed by hand against a hardcoded secret and an unpinned verify.
- **Landed:** #705 (Closes #706) · pack version 1.

## 2026-09-01 · moved · the pack's advisory watch becomes canon curation's upstream-watch (#1569)
- **Reason:** a pack's `tasks/` are work every member repo runs, so the monthly `jwt-advisory-watch`
  charged the fleet for a duty that is the canon's, and made it unrepeatable: one bespoke watcher
  per pack that wanted one. Deliberately dropped with it: scanning a member's own lockfiles for JWT
  libraries inside an advisory's affected range, which is dependency-update tooling rather than pack
  content, and nothing replaces it.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** the README's `## Upstream` section, one line per source naming what to watch, where
  it publishes and the state this pack's content was last reconciled against; presence of the
  section is the whole opt-in, and the canon's own monthly task reads it. The pack now declares
  three sources: RFC 8725, the GitHub Advisory Database's JWT libraries for the classes of flaw the
  skills teach against, and the Handbook itself.
- **Landed:** #1569 (Closes #1568) · pack version 60901.1.

## 2026-09-25 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` rises to 60925.1
- **Reason:** this pack's checks declare `on_fail`, which an older engine does not read; the pack
  update holds this version until the member's engine is at 60925.1.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces.

## 2026-09-27 · born · a pitch paragraph for the dashboard's plain-repo view
- **Reason:** the dashboard shows a repo that does not run Claudinite the packs that fit it, and the
  owner asked for one paragraph per pack naming its main skills and process gains, with rough counts
  so it outlives the pack's growth.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `pitch` field, beside `ruleRoutingGuidance`.

## 2026-09-27 · scope-changed · the fingerprint is a `relevanceDetector` spec, not a function
- **Reason:** the owner asked for fingerprints a reader holding only GitHub's API can judge cheaply
  - a tree listing, a code search, then only the files that search names - which a function over a
  synchronous `read` cannot offer.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `relevanceDetector` (engine/pack_loader/relevance-detector.mjs): `paths`, optional `text`,
  `search` terms; it answers exactly what the retired `detect` answered, proven over 4,000 composed
  repos before the change.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the fingerprint's patterns are written as source strings
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data cannot hold a RegExp; each pattern is its source string, or {
  source, flags } where it carries a flag, and loads to the same RegExp.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the manifest becomes pack.json
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data is read with no import and by any tool; the conversion wrote
  the module's evaluated export, and the pack loads identically.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** pack.json, which the loader prefers over pack.mjs; a canon pack now needs engine
  60928.1, the first to read it.

## 2026-09-28 · scope-changed · the fingerprint reads the dependency manifests, not the source
- **Reason:** a library a repo uses is declared in its package.json, requirements*.txt or
  pyproject.toml; reading those is one near-root file each rather than every source file, and a
  usage no manifest backs is not an adoption.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), in review of #2382.
- **Mechanism:** paths over near-root dependency manifests, text over the declared package names.

## 2026-10-03 · scope-changed · the first version on the cn floor
- **Reason:** `60928.1` named a Node engine version, which `cn` read only as the legacy two-part
  form; with that tolerance retired (ClaudiniteEngine#18) a two-part entry is one `cn` skips, so
  the pack's newest version names `61001.1.0`, the floor every ported pack names. Nothing in the
  pack runs, so no higher floor is a claim anything tests.
- **Actor:** build lead, ClaudinitePacks#30 T1.
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces. jwt 61003.1.
