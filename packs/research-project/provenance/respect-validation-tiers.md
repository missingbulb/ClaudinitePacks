## 2026-07-04 · born · Project-type templates catalog + categorize-at-bootstrap flow (#116)
- **Source:** the gRatio project's `docs/research_process_playbook.md`, lifted verbatim as the first
  entry in a project-type templates catalog and scrubbed of the one project-specific path it
  hardcoded.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** a rule of the playbook template `templates/research-project.md`, triggered on
  "Respect the two validation tiers".
- **Landed:** #116 (Closes #115).

## 2026-07-27 · reworded · Tighten every RULES.md to when + what + one non-obvious fact (#467)
- **Reason:** the sweep cut from every rule in the corpus the consequence prose arguing for a rule
  rather than enabling it, leaving each as trigger, instruction and at most one clause of why, kept
  only where the rule would otherwise land as ceremony a reader skips. This pack went from 3,299
  words to 3,127, corpus-wide 17,127 to 15,220. No rule was merged or dropped, and every path,
  command and concrete detail stayed.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #467 (Closes #466) · pack version 1.
