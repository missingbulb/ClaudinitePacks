## 2026-07-11 · born · Growth promote (2026-07-11): portable lessons into canon (#222)
- **Source:** the gRatio project's local docs, read by the 2026-07-11 growth-promote run.
- **Reason:** sophistication is not accuracy: when the guiding signal is noisy or penetrates the
  structure unevenly, a “smarter” local correction can measurably lose to a plain uniform one,
  so the naive baseline is kept as the thing to beat rather than assumed beaten.
- **Actor:** the growth-promote run, merged by @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 4.8, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** a RULES.md rule, triggered on "Beat the naive baseline, or drop it.".
- **Rejected:** a check - every candidate of the run landed at the prose rung, each being judgment
  or platform knowledge with no clean static signature authorable and fixture-able unattended.
- **Landed:** #222 (Refs #99) · pack version 1.

## 2026-07-27 · reworded · Tighten every RULES.md to when + what + one non-obvious fact (#467)
- **Reason:** the sweep cut from every rule in the corpus the consequence prose arguing for a rule
  rather than enabling it, leaving each as trigger, instruction and at most one clause of why, kept
  only where the rule would otherwise land as ceremony a reader skips. This pack went from 3,299
  words to 3,127, corpus-wide 17,127 to 15,220. No rule was merged or dropped, and every path,
  command and concrete detail stayed.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #467 (Closes #466) · pack version 1.

## 2026-09-01 · reaffirmed · Recover the rationale #467 cut from the shared packs into references.md (#1575)
- **Reason:** #467 cut this rule's rationale in July 2026, before a `references.md` existed to hold
  it. Mining every commit that shrank a still-standing canon rule found 49 shrink events, 43 on
  rules that still stand, and #467 the only genuine seam; this pack's one recoverable clause carries
  a failure mode a review can weigh, so it was restored as the rule's reference entry with the rule
  line left exactly as #467 set it.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Retire when:** reaffirm while the method is scored against a baseline; retire if no naive
  baseline is definable for the task.
- **Landed:** #1575 (Closes #1571) · pack version 60901.1.
