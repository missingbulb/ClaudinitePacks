## 2026-07-23 · born · Add leaflet pack (distilled from EdFringeNow) (#403)
- **Source:** missingbulb/EdFringeNow, the "Fringe Discover" static site - its `index.html` CDN
  wiring and the map, marker and cluster code in `js/app.js`; the first fleet member seen using
  Leaflet.
- **Reason:** no canon pack owned Leaflet, and the member's usage yielded gotchas true of any
  Leaflet map read cold rather than anything about that site; the member's own scraping is its
  one-off and stayed there.
- **Actor:** the weekly pack-discovery run, merged by @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 4.8, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** the pack manifest, fingerprinted by an actual Leaflet reference - a CDN asset
  (`leaflet@` / `leaflet.js` / `leaflet.css`) in HTML, or an `L.map` / `L.tileLayer` /
  `L.markerClusterGroup` call in source; the marker only suspects the pack, and declaring it stays
  the project's call.
- **Landed:** #403 (Refs #303) · pack version 1.

## 2026-07-27 · reworded · the rules shed their "Grounded in <project file>" notes (#467)
- **Reason:** the notes restate the rule and point at one project's tree from a project-agnostic
  pack. The same sweep cut every rule to its trigger, its instruction and at most one clause of why.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #467 (Refs #123, #466) · pack version 1.

## 2026-09-01 · reaffirmed · the rationale #467 cut is recovered; the grounded-in notes stay cut (#1575)
- **Reason:** the two rules that argue from a ground - the mid-page scroll trap and the OSM
  attribution licence term - lost that ground to the tightening sweep, and a rule whose reason
  nothing records can be reaffirmed on the wrong basis. The per-project "Grounded in" notes were
  re-examined in the same pass and stayed cut.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #1575 (Refs #1571) · pack version 60901.1.

## 2026-09-03 · reworded · `RULES.md` carries rules, not a description of the pack (#1634)
- **Reason:** the file opened with a paragraph saying what the pack covers. It changes nothing a
  session does, every session in every declaring repo paid for it, and the README and the manifest's
  `ruleRoutingGuidance` already carried it.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #1634 (Closes #1632) · pack version 60902.1.

## 2026-09-25 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` rises to 60925.1
- **Reason:** this pack's checks declare `on_fail`, which an older engine does not read; the pack
  update holds this version until the member's engine is at 60925.1.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces.

## 2026-09-27 · born · a pitch paragraph for the dashboard's plain-repo view
- **Reason:** the dashboard shows a repo that does not run Claudinite the packs that fit it, and the
  owner asked for one paragraph per pack naming its main skills and process gains, with rough counts
  so it outlives the pack's growth.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `pitch` field, beside `ruleRoutingGuidance`.

## 2026-09-27 · scope-changed · the fingerprint is a `relevanceDetector` spec, not a function
- **Reason:** the owner asked for fingerprints a reader holding only GitHub's API can judge cheaply
  - a tree listing, a code search, then only the files that search names - which a function over a
  synchronous `read` cannot offer.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `relevanceDetector` (engine/pack_loader/relevance-detector.mjs): `paths`, optional `text`,
  `search` terms; it answers exactly what the retired `detect` answered, proven over 4,000 composed
  repos before the change.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the fingerprint's patterns are written as source strings
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data cannot hold a RegExp; each pattern is its source string, or {
  source, flags } where it carries a flag, and loads to the same RegExp.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the manifest's comments leave it, their decisions recorded here
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data carries no comments. What they decided: the fingerprint's text
  spells leaflet in either case letter by letter because its L.map( half must not ignore case, and a
  page calling only L.map( loads Leaflet from a file that names it, so the search terms still reach
  the repo.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests, their comments deleted or moved
  to a README or provenance.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the manifest becomes pack.json
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data is read with no import and by any tool; the conversion wrote
  the module's evaluated export, and the pack loads identically.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** pack.json, which the loader prefers over pack.mjs; a canon pack now needs engine
  60928.1, the first to read it.

## 2026-10-03 · scope-changed · the coded checks run on cn
- **Reason:** the two checks are rewritten in Go against the SDK, so a cn member runs them; the
  version also moves the pack off the two-part Node floor.
- **Actor:** build lead, ClaudinitePacks#30 T2.
- **Mechanism:** `checks/*.go` against the SDK, `test/` through `cn check --pack leaflet`;
  `minEngineVersion` `61001.1.0`, the floor the SDK names. leaflet 61003.1.

## 2026-10-04 · scope-changed · the version takes the <major>.<day>.<n> form
- **Reason:** pack versions follow the Engine's `<major>.<day>.<n>` scheme; an index sorts every
  earlier version below one in that form, so this one outranks what the pack store already holds.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking that pack versions follow the same scheme.
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5.5
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `version`, which the release now requires in this form for a new
  version. leaflet 1.61004.1.
