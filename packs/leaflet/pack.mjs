This pack gives Claude Code sessions a few rules for feature-detecting plugins with a fallback to core, disabling scroll-wheel zoom on embedded maps, keeping attribution, and transforming markers correctly. A couple of checks block CDN assets without integrity hashes and tile layers without attribution.',
