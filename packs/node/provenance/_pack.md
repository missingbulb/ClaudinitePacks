## 2026-07-06 · born · Context-relief architecture: packs (prose + checks) and skills, with enforcement (#128)
- **Source:** the restructure's per-rule conversion inventory, which audited the whole corpus and
  gave each technology's gotchas a pack of its own.
- **Reason:** the pack opened prose-only, its two jsdom divergences being runtime knowledge with no
  artifact signature a check could read.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Fable 5, per the commit trailer.
- **Mechanism:** a pack fingerprinted on a repo-root `package.json`, its prose injected at
  SessionStart in any repo that declares it.
- **Landed:** #128 (Closes #127, #131) · pack version 1.

## 2026-07-08 · reworded · the fingerprint matches a marker one directory down (#185)
- **Source:** landing #165 in the ShoutsAndWhispers consumer, a monorepo keeping its Node functions
  in `functions/`: detection failed there and the repo had to declare the pack plus an
  accept-with-reason just to satisfy `pack-declaration`.
- **Reason:** the root or one directory down covers a monorepo's `functions/` or `server/` dir, as
  the android and ios packs already did; never deeper, so a `package.json` in a nested example or
  fixture tree cannot trip detection.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #185 (Closes #184) · pack version 1.

## 2026-07-10 · reworded · the pack declares what a web session's environment needs (#204)
- **Source:** the pack-driven cloud environment model, which moved install logic out of per-repo
  setup scripts and onto the pack that owns the technology.
- **Reason:** the Node runtime ships in the base image but a repo's modules do not, so a test or
  build would trigger a confusing mid-session install; the pack installs them at environment-image
  build instead. Where `package.json` lives varies per repo, so the directories are a per-project
  param the member supplies rather than a value the pack could pick, and the probe asserts the
  requirement directly, `node_modules` being present, rather than trusting a recorded version.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude Opus 4.8, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #204 (Closes #208) · pack version 1.

## 2026-09-03 · reworded · RULES.md carries rules, not a description of the pack (#1634)
- **Source:** the audit #1625 gave one pack, run across the other 25.
- **Reason:** the opening paragraph and the jsdom section's "Two that recur" changed nothing a
  session does while every session in every declaring repo paid for them, and the README plus the
  manifest's `ruleRoutingGuidance` already carry what they said, checked here before dropping.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Model:** Claude, per the commit trailer.
- **Landed:** #1634 (Closes #1632) · pack version 60902.1.

## 2026-09-25 · scope-changed · `minEngineVersion` rises to 60925.1
- **Reason:** this pack's checks declare `on_fail`, which an older engine does not read; the pack
  update holds this version until the member's engine is at 60925.1.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `minEngineVersion`, which the pack update enforces.

## 2026-09-27 · born · a pitch paragraph for the dashboard's plain-repo view
- **Reason:** the dashboard shows a repo that does not run Claudinite the packs that fit it, and the
  owner asked for one paragraph per pack naming its main skills and process gains, with rough counts
  so it outlives the pack's growth.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `pitch` field, beside `ruleRoutingGuidance`.

## 2026-09-27 · scope-changed · the fingerprint is a `relevanceDetector` spec, not a function
- **Reason:** the owner asked for fingerprints a reader holding only GitHub's API can judge cheaply
  - a tree listing, a code search, then only the files that search names - which a function over a
  synchronous `read` cannot offer.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner).
- **Mechanism:** the manifest's `relevanceDetector` (engine/pack_loader/relevance-detector.mjs): `paths`, optional `text`,
  `search` terms; it answers exactly what the retired `detect` answered, proven over 4,000 composed
  repos before the change.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the env setup and probe become templates over config.dirs
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data cannot hold the functions that expanded one command per
  directory; the template renders the same commands.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.

## 2026-09-28 · reworded · the fingerprint's patterns are written as source strings
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data cannot hold a RegExp; each pattern is its source string, or {
  source, flags } where it carries a flag, and loads to the same RegExp.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.

## 2026-09-28 · moved · the manifest becomes pack.json
- **Reason:** a manifest that is data is read with no import and by any tool; the conversion wrote
  the module's evaluated export, and the pack loads identically.
- **Actor:** @missingbulb (owner), asking for pack.json manifests.
- **Mechanism:** pack.json, which the loader prefers over pack.mjs; a canon pack now needs engine
  60928.1, the first to read it.
