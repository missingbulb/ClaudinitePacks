  pitch: 'Browser automation in a repo tends to fail in ways that look like product bugs: a driver downloading its own browser, screenshots that differ between machines, waits that guess when the page is ready. This pack gives Claude Code sessions some twenty rules for resolving the browser from the environment, serving pages from a fake origin with the network aborted by default, pinning fonts and rasterisation for stable goldens, and capturing reliably. A few checks catch network-idle waits, captures taken before fonts load, and insecure fake origins.',
