// point of the function, not an accident of the if-chain: a member with no scheduler
// is ALSO behind, and reporting "behind" would send the reader chasing a symptom.
//
// What it does NOT read is the AGE of the stamped ref. The versioned flows never
// rewrite `ref`, so on a well-maintained member the stamp is frozen and its age
// measures nothing — a date measure calls the whole fleet behind on one arbitrary
// day (#1025). The verdict is the version gap and only the version gap.
