# Fleet update — force every member to update now

**This task runs no agent, and no schedule.** It declares `trigger: request`: the scheduler run never asks it, and its `code_work` is `cn fleet update`, the engine's lever (the `fleet/update` package), which the executor runs when — and only when — a human creates an item for it. This file is the human-facing record of what that is; there is no agent phase.

## How to pull the lever

Create the work item, from a checkout of this repo with `GITHUB_TOKEN` set:

```
.claudinite/bin/cn work create claudinite-fleet-sheepdog/fleet-update \
  --context "REPOS=Alpha Beta" \
  --context "DRY_RUN=true" \
  --context "INCLUDE_DORMANT=true" \
  --context "FOLLOW_MINUTES=30"
```

Every `--context` line is optional:

```
REPOS=Alpha Beta            ← limit to these repos (bare name or owner/name, SPACE-separated); omit for every covered member
DRY_RUN=true                ← report what would fire, fire nothing
INCLUDE_DORMANT=true        ← dormant members are skipped by default — they stopped their own scheduler on purpose
FOLLOW_MINUTES=30           ← how long to follow members to current before giving up on what is left (default 20)
```

Values are space-separated because the parameter bag splits `KEY=value` pairs on commas. The two safety knobs are read from the item's Context and from nowhere else: an item created without them runs unscoped and live.

## What it does

Enumerate every repo under the configured owner over the `FLEET_GITHUB_TOKEN` PAT and, for each **covered, non-dormant** member, dispatch that member's own `claudinite-scheduler.yml` with `wake: update` — the same button the owner would press in that repo's Actions tab, pressed across the fleet in one run. The wake lever names one task, so each member does exactly one thing: update its mount.

Nothing is updated *here*, and nothing is written to any member — no commit, no issue, no comment. Each member updates its own mount, with its own token, under its own scheduler and delivery policy; if its update needs an agent, that member's own executor runs it. The enforcer **dispatches**; the member **executes**. That is the whole trust model: no agent anywhere needs cross-repo access, and the one fleet credential is the PAT with Actions write.

Then it **follows** each dispatched member until that member's own update would move nothing — its engine pin and every declared pack at the published versions it reads — reusing the measure [`fleet-roster`](../fleet-roster/) makes for its freshness section. A Node member (a root `.claudinite-settings.json`) is dispatched too and followed by movement alone: it has `moved` once its declaration's stamp changes.

Every repo under the owner lands in the run summary under exactly one state — so a fleet-wide force is never mistaken for fleet-wide coverage. Dispatched members are reported by **outcome**:

```
updated             ← was behind the published versions, and reached them during this run
already-current     ← was at the published versions before the dispatch, so its own update correctly declined
moved               ← a Node member whose declaration's stamp moved
did-not-update      ← its scheduler ran and it is still behind — go and read that run
never-started       ← the dispatch was accepted and no run followed it
unknown             ← the member could not be read
```

`already-current` is a **success**. A member at the published versions has nothing to do, its `update` precondition says so, and demanding work of it would report a fault where there is none.

## What "current" does not mean

Freshness here is the **published version numbers**. Content that shipped without a version bump moves no number, so it is invisible here. The report says this itself rather than letting the word imply more than was checked.

## Why this is not the retired 45-minute sleep

The old follow was a blind fixed wait: every run paid it in full, whatever the fleet was doing, which is what forced the lever to be a standalone workflow. The follow polls a **real terminal condition** instead — each member leaves the loop the moment it reads current. An already-current fleet finishes on the first pass, in seconds. Only a member genuinely mid-update costs any waiting, and the budget (`FOLLOW_MINUTES`) bounds even that.

## Why a task and not a workflow (any more)

The standalone `fleet-baseline.yml` workflow (retired 2026-08-11, #749) lived in the enforcer's `.github/` — the one place the nightly update can never push (#649), so every change to it crossed the fleet by the slow withhold-and-hand-to-the-agent path. As a task, the lever ships with the ordinary vendor refresh like everything else, and the repo's vendored scheduler stays its **only** workflow. The typed `workflow_dispatch` inputs the old workflow offered are carried by the item's Context above.

## Failure is loud

A member that could not be dispatched — a missing scheduler workflow, a PAT without Actions write, a workflow GitHub disabled — is named in the summary and the sweep exits non-zero. **So is a member that was dispatched and never reached the published versions**: that is the failure this whole follow exists to surface, and the one the dispatch-count report used to show as a success. The executor parks the item, so either escalates rather than silently leaving part of the fleet behind.

## Why the declaration reads as it does

`trigger: request`: it answers no recurring question, so nothing asks it; the ONLY way it runs is a work item created by hand, its parameters riding the item's Context. `code_work: "cn fleet update"` with `code_work_required_secrets: ["FLEET_GITHUB_TOKEN"]`: pure engine code, the PAT reaching that one step alone. Nothing agentic happens HERE — each member's own update may hand off to that member's own agent, which is the fan-out model's point: the enforcer dispatches, the member executes, and no agent anywhere needs cross-repo access.

The dispatch half is one enumeration plus a declaration read and one POST per member — under a minute. What sizes the 1800s bound is the follow: the sweep stays until every dispatched member is current, and a member's own update takes 5–10 minutes end to end. The follow gives up at its default 20 minutes and reports what it was still waiting on, so the bound sits above that with room for the dispatch walk and the final probe — otherwise the platform kills the run at the bound and the report is never printed, which is the one outcome worse than a slow one.
