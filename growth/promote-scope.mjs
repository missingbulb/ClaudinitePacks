// The write-surface gate for the growth PROMOTE phase (growth/promote.md).
//
// Promote's write surface is bounded to the shared canon's two homes — packs/
// and skills/. This module is the GUARANTEE: any changed path outside packs/ or
// skills/ fails the gate. The promote AGENT never runs it and needn't know it
// exists — CI runs it automatically on the promote PR (checks-ci.yml, gated on
// the growth-promote branch prefix). Per the unattended-agents skill, "Prose is
// a request; the post-hoc diff check is the guarantee."
//
// Why CI branch-gates it instead of registering it as a pack/skill check that
// runs on every PR: the "packs/skills only" boundary is true for PROMOTE alone —
// an ordinary engine change (this file included) legitimately edits growth/,
// checks/, routines/, … Nothing in the tree marks a diff as a promote run, so no
// always-on check could self-gate to promote; the promote PR's branch prefix is
// the signal CI keys on.
