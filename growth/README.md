# growth/ — how instructions are learned and flow between projects and the canon

This folder holds the **growth lifecycle**: how a lesson is learned in a consuming project, lifted into the shared Claudinite canon when it's portable, and pruned back out of the project once the canon owns it. It is the single home for that whole handover — replacing the older split across a per-repo lessons digest, a per-repo optimize routine, and a cross-repo handoff pipeline (Action + PAT + labelled issue), all now gone.

The lifecycle is **three phases with a barrier between each**, sequenced daily by the fleet orchestrator ([../routines/auto-all-repos-maintenance.md](../routines/auto-all-repos-maintenance.md)):

```
Phase 1  EXTRACT   per project, in parallel   → commits directly to each project's main
   ⟨barrier: every project's extract run has finished⟩
Phase 2  PROMOTE   central, once              → PR against Claudinite main
   ⟨barrier: promotion's PR is opened⟩
Phase 3  DEDUP     per project, in parallel   → PR against each project's main
```

**Phase 1 commits straight to `main`; phases 2 and 3 open a PR for the owner to approve** (see [the design choice below](#two-design-choices-baked-in-here)). Every phase still reads only what's **already merged** on `main`. Because extract now lands on `main` immediately, promote reads that same night's extractions when it runs after the barrier — so extract → promote propagates **within one night**. Promote, though, still opens a PR, so its canon changes aren't merged until the owner approves; dedup therefore reads the *previously* merged canon, and promote → dedup still spans an **approval cycle**. The daily order and barriers are kept so each phase runs on the freshest *merged* state.

- **[extract.md](extract.md)** — phase 1, per project. Captures the last 24h of bugs/PRs/commits into the project's **own** docs, at the project's own level (generalizing is phase 2's job). **Commits directly to the project's `main`** (no per-run PR — it writes only local docs); logs to a per-project tracking issue.
- **[promote.md](promote.md)** — phase 2, central. Reads every project's local docs, **generalizes** the portable lessons, routes each to the right canon home, and opens a PR against Claudinite's `main`. This is the sole judgment gate before shared canon.
- **[dedup.md](dedup.md)** — phase 3, per project. Prunes local items the canon covers, **keeping** items the canon states too generally for that project. Opens a PR against the project's `main`.
- **[item-routing.md](item-routing.md)** — the shared worthiness + routing method phase 2 (and any other caller) defers to, so every decision about admitting and placing an item is made the same way.
- **[extracting-lessons.md](../skills/lessons-learned/extracting-lessons.md)** — the method for mining a single working session for lessons: the owner's on-demand "learned lessons" command, and the pass the merge flow runs after every merge. It now lives **with the `lessons-learned` skill** (not in `growth/`), since it's the content that skill carries (invoked by the `merge-to-main` skill); it's noted here only as the session-scoped sibling of the nightly lifecycle. Delivered as a PR for review — the same approval gate the daily phases use.
- **prose-to-checks sweep** — a periodic central pass (the `prose-to-checks` skill, [../skills/prose-to-checks/SKILL.md](../skills/prose-to-checks/SKILL.md)) that mines the corpus's **existing** prose for always-testable rules the conversion missed and converts the strongest ones. Where promote descends the ladder for each *new* lesson, this one works the *backlog*, so the corpus keeps shedding context over time. Opens a PR like every other growth change.

## Identifying a project's local docs (the same way in all three phases)

Every phase operates on a project's **local instruction docs**, and all three identify them the **same way**: by following the import/pointer graph out from the repo's **root `CLAUDE.md`** — the very graph the agent itself loads — and treating everything under the mounted canon at `.claudinite/` as **read-only canon, not local docs**. So "a project's local docs" means precisely *the project's own docs reachable from its `CLAUDE.md`, minus the canon it mounts*. Don't scan the whole tree for stray Markdown; the `CLAUDE.md` graph is the authoritative set, and a doc no `CLAUDE.md` path reaches isn't part of the project's instructions.

The three phases only differ in *how they read that set*, never in *which set it is*: phases 1 and 3 run inside the repo and read it from the working tree; phase 2 runs centrally and walks the same graph over the GitHub API (get-file-contents from `CLAUDE.md` outward). Extract writes into it, promote reads from it, dedup prunes within it — all against the identical, `CLAUDE.md`-anchored corpus.

## Two design choices baked in here

- **Review gates by blast radius, not uniformly.** **Promote** (phase 2) opens a PR — it's the sole judgment gate before the **shared canon** every repo reads, so it always needs a human eye. **Dedup** (phase 3) opens a PR too — a wrongful prune deletes a real local lesson. **Extract** (phase 1) and the nightly **re-bootstrap**, by contrast, commit **directly to `main`**: extract writes only a project's *own* local docs, re-bootstrap only refreshes mechanical wiring, and the owner has opted out of a per-run PR on both to keep the fleet's daily maintenance from flooding review requests (a member can flip its re-bootstrap side to PR delivery via the explicit `maintenance.delivery` flag in its `.claudinite-checks.json`). (The owner's *on-demand, in-session* "learned lessons" command still delivers a PR — see [extracting-lessons.md](../skills/lessons-learned/extracting-lessons.md) and the owner preferences.)
- **Central promotion, no plumbing.** Phase 2 runs from the Claudinite home repo with a fleet-wide token, so it reads every project and opens its canon PR directly in this repo. That's why the old handoff machinery (a consumer-side Action, a Claudinite-scoped PAT, a labelled-issue up-path) no longer exists: there's no repo boundary left to tunnel across.

These specs are Claudinite-internal orchestration inputs. The session-lessons method now lives **with the `lessons-learned` skill** ([extracting-lessons.md](../skills/lessons-learned/extracting-lessons.md)), surfaced on demand rather than force-loaded. Of the rest, consuming repos vendor the per-project phases ([extract.md](extract.md), [dedup.md](dedup.md)) the same way they vendor the other routines; [promote.md](promote.md), [item-routing.md](item-routing.md), and the prose-to-checks sweep run only centrally.
