# Growth phase 3 — dedup local docs against the canon (per project)

Phase 3 of the [growth lifecycle](README.md): reconcile a project's local docs against the shared **canon** it consumes (Claudinite, vendored read-only), pruning local items the canon now covers. It runs after promotion, and opens a PR against the project's default branch for the owner to approve. Often there's nothing to prune, and that's fine.

> This phase only prunes local docs against the canon; lifting local items up into the canon is [promote](promote.md)'s job.

## Conventions used in this doc

- **Default branch.** `main` stands for **your repository's default branch** — substitute whatever your repo uses.
- **GitHub API access.** Updating the tracking issue goes through your environment's GitHub API tooling — the **GitHub MCP tools** or the `gh` CLI. In sandboxed/automation environments the shell often reaches only a **git-over-HTTPS proxy with no GitHub API**; there, use the MCP tools, never `gh` / `curl`. Use whichever your runtime exposes.
- **The mounted canon.** The exact canon revision your project currently consumes — compare against *that*, not a live fetch. Under session-start sync it's the latest `main` (so a promotion is visible only once its PR is merged, not the moment phase 2 opens it); under a pinned submodule it's the pin (so the item lands here only once the pointer is bumped). Either way you prune only against what the project actually mounts.
- **The project's local docs.** The set identified in [growth/README.md](README.md). That's the corpus this phase prunes within; the mounted canon is never a prune target, only the yardstick you prune *against*.

## What it does: prune / rephrase local docs the canon now covers

When the canon has **absorbed** a practice a local doc still carries — most often an item [promote](promote.md) lifted up and the canon now owns — the local copy is redundant. This phase:

- **Removes** the now-duplicated local item, since the canon is the single source of truth for portable rules.
- **Rephrases** a local procedure when the canon's wording of the same idea has changed, so the local docs stay consistent with the canon they point at.

**Keep a local item only if it says *more* than the canon — not merely says it more specifically.** Every local item is more specific than the canon, so specificity alone is never the test. Distinguish two cases:

- **The general rule in local dress** — it makes the canon's point but leans on this project's classes, files, or names to make it. Once the canon covers the point, those names were only illustration: prune it.
- **A stronger point about a narrower case** — it asserts something the canon's general rule leaves out: a tighter constraint, a sharper claim that holds for this project's narrower situation. Keep it.

So ask not "is it specific" (it always is) but "does it only lean on specific names to make the general point, or does it make a point the canon doesn't?" Prune the first; keep the second.

## Discipline

- **Only remove a local item you can show the mounted canon genuinely covers — quote the canon line.** When unsure, leave it; a wrongful prune deletes a real local lesson.
- **Open a single PR against `main`** — one PR for the whole run's prunes, not one per item — never a direct push. This is an unattended routine, on a capable model, editing the project's *own* docs; the owner wants a human approval gate on every growth change.
- If an edit touches something a test reads, run the project's offline test suite and keep it green before pushing.

## Tracking

Log each run that changed a doc as a **dated comment** on this routine's standing tracking issue (found **by title**, never a hard-coded number; open it if missing, reopen it if it was closed while runs still need logging) — naming what was pruned and the canon line that now covers it. A run that prunes nothing logs nothing.

## Run on a capable model

Proving the mounted canon genuinely covers a local item before pruning it — and telling "the canon now owns this" from "the canon states this too generally, keep the local cut" — is a **judgment call**. A downgraded model prunes a real lesson; the review PR is a backstop, but a wrongful prune is easy to wave through in review, so don't lean on it. Run this routine on a capable model.

## What this routine must never do

- **Never edit the read-only canon** — it only prunes *local* docs against it.
- **Never prune a local item without quoting the mounted-canon line that covers it** — when unsure, leave it.
- **Never prune a local item that makes a stronger point about a narrower case** than the canon — that isn't redundancy. (A local item that only restates the canon in project-specific names *is* prunable once the canon covers the point.)
